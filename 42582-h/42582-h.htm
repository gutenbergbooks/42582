<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
FROM MAINE TO CALIFORNIA</h2>

<p>It was a long journey for a little girl, so long indeed
that the old life had almost faded from her mind, and
seemed like something done in another existence.
When she was younger still she had once surprised her
mother by saying, "Mother, where did I live before I
came here?" The pale, care-worn woman had glanced
at her in vague surprise and answered rather fretfully,
"Why, nowhere, child."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I remember things," said the little girl
with a confident air, looking out of eyes that seemed
to take an added shade from her present emotions.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You can't remember things that
never happened. That's imagining them, and it isn't
true. If you told them they would be falsehoods.
There, go out and get me a basket of chips."</p>

<p>She was afraid of telling falsehoods, most of those
rigid people called them by their plain name, "lies,"
and whipped their children. So the little girl kept them
to herself; she was a very good and upright child as a
general thing and knew very little about her tricky
father. But she went on imagining. Especially when
she studied geography, which she was extravagantly
fond of, yet she could never quite decide which country
she had lived in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>Through those months of journeying in the big vessel
over strange waters, for she had been born in an
inland hamlet with a great woods of hemlock, spruce,
and fir behind the little cottage, and two or three small
creeks wandering about, she had many strange
thoughts. Though at first she was quite ill, but Uncle
Jason was the best nurse in the world, and presently
she began to run about and get acquainted. There
were only a few women passengers. One middle-aged,
with a son sixteen, who was working his way; a few
wives emigrating with their husbands, three women
friends who were in the hope of finding an easier life
and perhaps husbands, though they hardly admitted
that to each other.</p>

<p>She often sat in Uncle Jason's lap, hugged up to his
breast. Of course, her mother had been his sister, they
had settled upon that, and he did not contradict. She
was lulled by the motion of the vessel and often fell
asleep, but in her waking moments these were the memories
that were growing more vague and getting tangled
up with various things.</p>

<p>Her father had taught school at South Berwick the
winter she could recall most readily, and came home
on Saturday morning, spending most of the time at the
store. Woodville was only a sort of hamlet, though it
had a church, a school, and a general store. Sometimes
he would go back on Sunday, but oftener early
Monday morning. Then late in the summer he was
home for a while, and went away after talks with her
mother that did not always seem pleasant. He took
very little notice of her, in her secret heart she felt
afraid of him, though he was seldom really cross to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
her. And then he went away and did not appear again
until the winter, when there seemed a great deal of
talking and business, and he brought a boxful of
clothes for them, and seemed in excellent spirits. He
was in business in Boston, and would move them all
there at once, if grandmother would consent, but she
was old, and had had a stroke, and could not get about
without a cane. The old house was hers and she would
finish out her days there. Of course, then, her mother
could not go. She had a new, warm woollen frock and
a cloak that was the envy of the other children, and
absolute city shoes that she could only wear on Sunday,
and, of course, were presently outgrown.</p>

<p>She studied up everything she could concerning Boston,
but her mother would not talk about it. In the
summer, grandmother had another stroke and then was
bedridden. It was a poor little village, and everybody
had hard work to live, summers were especially busy,
and winters were long and hard. Grandmother was
fretful, and wandered a little in her mind. Now and
then a neighbor came in to spell Mrs. Westbury, and
there was always some mysterious talking that her
mother did not care for her to hear. Grandmother
lived more than a year and was a helpless burden at
the last. After she had gone the poor mother sank
down, overwhelmed with trouble. David Westbury
had persuaded the old lady to sign over the house for
a business venture he was to make in Boston that
would put him on the road to fortune. And now it
was found that he had decamped, that there had been
no business but speculating, and she no longer had a
home for herself and her child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>They were very poor. People bore straits bravely in
those days and suffered in silence. The poor mother
grew paler and thinner and had a hard cough. In the
spring they would be homeless. By spring she would
be&mdash;and what would happen to the child! A little
bound-out girl, perhaps.</p>

<p>Laverne was not taken into these sorrowful confidences.
She did not go to school, her mother needed
to be waited upon. One bright afternoon she went out
to skate on the creek. The school children joined her,
and it was almost dark when they started for home.
The little girl's heart upbraided her, but she had carried
in the last armful of wood, and had not told her
mother. What would they do to-morrow!</p>

<p>She went in hesitatingly. Oh, how good and warm
the room felt and two candles were burning. A man
sat beside the stove with a sort of frank, bright, yet
weather-beaten face, a mop of chestnut-colored hair, a
beard growing up to his very mouth, but with the
brightest blue eyes she had ever seen, merry blue eyes,
too, that looked as if there was just a twinkle back of
the lashes.</p>

<p>"This is my little girl, Laverne," said her mother.
"We have always called her Verne, seeing there were
three of the same name. And this is"&mdash;the mother's
tone had a curious tremble in it, as if she caught her
breath&mdash;"this is Uncle Jason."</p>

<p>The first glance made them friends. They both
smiled. She was like her mother in the young days,
and had the same dimple in her cheek, and the one in
her chin where the children used to hold a buttercup.
She put out both hands. They had been so lonely, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
poor, and she was glad all over with a strange feeling,
just as if they had come to better times.</p>

<p>What a supper they had! She was very hungry.
She had been quite used to eating bread and molasses,
or a little moist brown sugar. And here was a great
chunk of butter on the edge of her plate, and the room
was fragrant with the smell of broiled ham.</p>

<p>If she had known anything about fairies she would
have believed in enchantment at once. And there was
part of a splendid cake, and orange jam, and she could
hardly make it real. No neighbor had known all their
straits, and the little girl had borne them as bravely as
her mother. Then, so many people had pinches in the
winter, for crops were often poor.</p>

<p>She helped her mother with the dishes and then she
sat down on a stool beside Uncle Jason. Presently,
her head sank on his knee and she went fast asleep.
She never heard a word of what her mother and Uncle
Jason were saying.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he carried her into the bedroom and
laid her on the bed, and she never woke up while her
mother undressed her. He went over to the store
where he had bargained for a room. The storekeeper,
Mr. Lane, had been as much surprised to see Mr.
Chadsey as Mrs. Westbury. He had been born in the
old town and his romance had blossomed and blighted
here.</p>

<p>"Now, I tell you," Seth Lane said to his wife, when
the store was shut and they were preparing for bed,
"if that scalawag Westbury was dead there'd be a
weddin' in this town straight away. My, how Chadsey
was cut up over hearin' his mean villainy an' gettin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
hold of the house! I never b'lieved the old woman
knew what she was about. And Chadsey's come back
in the nick o' time, for I don't b'lieve she'll go through
March."</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey planned for their comfort, and went
to Boston the next day, but could find no trace of
David Westbury, dead or alive.</p>

<p>As for the little girl, when she woke up in the morning
she thought she had had the loveliest dream that
could ever haunt one. But when she saw the bountiful
breakfast she was amazed to the last degree.</p>

<p>"Was Uncle Jason really here?" she asked timidly.
She was quite sure her mother had been crying.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. He has gone to Boston and will be
back in a few days. Oh, Laverne, I hope you will
learn to love him. Some day, when you are older,
you will understand why he came back, and he will be
your best friend when"&mdash;when I am gone, she was
about to say, but checked herself, and substituted "all
your life. When I was a little girl he was a kind and
generous big boy. Then he went to sea, and was back
only a few times. For years I had heard nothing
from him&mdash;he has been round the world, everywhere.
And he has a big, tender heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure I shall be glad to love him. Why,
you seem to go right to his heart;" and the child's
face glowed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes." She began to cough and sat down
suddenly, putting her handkerchief to her mouth.</p>

<p>"The salt, quick, Verne," she gasped.</p>

<p>She lay on the old wooden settee and stuffed her
mouth full of salt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what can I do?" cried the child, in mild alarm.</p>

<p>"Run for Aunt Cynthy Beers. Tell her to come
quick."</p>

<p>The neighbor, who was the village nurse, came back
with the child. Then she was despatched for the doctor.
He shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Doctor, you must keep me alive a little while
longer," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are good for some time yet, only you must
not make the slightest exertion. Cynthy, how long
can you stay?"</p>

<p>"Ten days or so. Then I have to go over on the
Creek," she answered laconically.</p>

<p>"That will do." Then he gave sundry charges to
Miss Beers, and left the remedies she was to use, but
that lady knew what was meant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury beckoned the nurse to her when he
had gone.</p>

<p>"Don't tell Laverne," she said. "Don't say anything
about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's cruel. Why, she ought to know and be
prepared."</p>

<p>"No, no; I will not have a word said. I cannot
explain, no one can. And if she took it hard, don't you
see, it would drive me wild and shorten my days. I'm
all worn out. And she will be provided for."</p>

<p>Everybody was kind and solicitous, sending in
cooked food, offering to sit up at night, but Miss Beers
was equal to all demands. The sick woman really did
improve. Laverne hovered about her mother, read to
her out of her geography and Peter Parley's history,
as well as the sweetest hymns out of the hymn book.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Jimmy Cox came over and did the chores, provided
the wood, took Verne out on his sled, and the days
passed along. Jason Chadsey returned. Miss Beers
had to go her way, and a neighbor came in to do what
was needed. One day, before the minister and the
Squire, she gave her child to Jason Chadsey, who
promised to care for her and educate her, and keep her
from all harm.</p>

<p>"You both know that I loved her mother and would
gladly have married her in the old days, but untoward
fate intervened. I could find no trace of the child's
father. She has no near relatives to care for her, so
I shall be father to her, and Heaven may judge me at
the last."</p>

<p>He was holding the child on his knee that evening,
"You are to be my little girl always," he said, with
tender solemnity. "You shall be made happy as a
little bird. And if you will only love me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall, I do. And will you stay here? Mother
will be so glad. She was longing so to have you come
back. You will never go away again?"</p>

<p>"Never from you, my little girl;" and he kissed the
child's trust into perfect belief.</p>

<p>There were two more alarms, then the frail life went
out peacefully. The child was stunned. It had
seemed right for grandmother to leave a world that she
was forgetting about, but Laverne could not understand
all the mystery. Her mother had always been
quiet and reserved, it was the fashion in those days,
and the child could not miss the things she had never
had. And neither could she ever have understood her
sorrow over the great mistake in giving her such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
father. But Heaven had helped her to make amends,
for the child was the embodiment of her own youth.
It was all she had and she gave it to the man who had
loved her sincerely, glad and thankful that she was not
to be left to the uncertain charity of the world.</p>

<p>The frightened child clung very closely to him. The
worn furniture and bedding were distributed among
the neighbors, a few keepsakes collected, a few good-bys
said, and good wishes given, and they went first to
Boston and then to New York. Then they were to
go to the wonderful land of gold and sunshine, California.
They found it on the map. And there was
the long, long sail, and the little girl was going far
away from the only sorrow of her life, that was so
strangely mingled with the only dear love. For while
the other had been hedged about with the severe training
of the times, afraid of sinfulness in indulging in
what was called carnal affections, even in loving a child,
now she had the utmost tenderness lavished upon
her. She had no one but him, and that was a continual
joy and kept his heart at high tide. She was all
his.</p>

<p>Later she was to know about the young love between
them, and how when her mother was just fifteen he
had shipped for three years aboard a merchantman.
They had sailed about the Eastern seas, bought and
sold, and at last started for home, to be wrecked, and
nearly all had perished. Of the few saved there were
no tidings of Jason Chadsey. Laverne waited and
hoped and came to her twentieth birthday. David
Westbury was considered a smart young man. He had
been a clerk in a store, he had worked on a newspaper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
and taught school, and could turn his hand to a good
many things. He had a smooth tongue, too, and a
certain polish in his manner above the country youths.
Grandmother espoused his cause at once. Jason Chadsey
was dead, lovers were not so plentiful in these
small places, where the enterprising young men went
away. It was hard to stand out against one's own
mother, and all the years to come to be taunted as an
old maid. And so Laverne married David Westbury,
and when her little girl was a month old he came back
not altogether penniless, but it was too late.</p>

<p>He had roamed about the world a good deal. He
had made money, and spent it freely, lost some of it,
helped friends in distress. Now, he was going out to
that wonderful land that had been the dream of the Spaniard,
and another nation had brought the dream true.
He would visit the little old village once more, and see
how it had fared with his early love and his old friends,
and then say good-bye forever. And knowing she was
near to death, Laverne Westbury told him her sad
story, and he read between the broken sentences that
he had been her early love, her only love.</p>

<p>So they whiled the time away, the man's dreams
growing more vivid, the child's fading. They passed
strange countries, there were seas of peerless blue, seas
of emerald green, then strange colors commingled.
There were cloudless skies and broad sheets of sunshine
that seemed to envelop the whole world in a
blaze; there were nights of such glowing stars as one
seldom sees on land, there were gray days with sullen
winds, and storms that sent a thrill to the stoutest
hearts, when the vessel groaned and creaked and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
women cried in terror. But Laverne only crept closer
in Uncle Jason's arms and felt safe.</p>

<p>They stopped here and there at a port, places they
hunted up on the map, cities that seemed marvels to
the little girl, shores with waving blooming forests
and almost steaming fragrance. Strange birds, strange
many-hued fish, darting hither and thither, seaweed
that in the sunshine looked like masses of bloom, or
living things swimming about. Curious people, too,
speaking languages no little girl could understand, then
leaving the warmth, and shivering with blasts of cold
air, wonderful islands and capes jutting out&mdash;some
bleak and bare and rocky, others shining in verdure and
waving smiles of welcome, it seemed; going safely
round the Horn with half their journey done and finding
more wonders, great mountain ranges, shores
thickly studded with islands, natives swimming about
like fishes, queer, half ruinous old Spanish towns, and
when they stopped at a port, such a clatter of tongues,
such a screaming of voices, such a confusion, one was
glad to get out of it to lovely, enchanting peace once
more.</p>

<p>Warmer grew the air with a languorous, permeating
fragrance. Moonlight silvering the water that leaped
softly up and down as if playing hide and seek with
the next wave. All the boundless space lighted with
it, going round the world, swelling, decreasing, a
golden crescent, then a pale gibbous thing and afterward
darkness when the ship crept softly along.</p>

<p>If one came in near the shore it was like the blast of a
furnace. Then, passing the equator with the queer
ceremony among the sailors, and looking across at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
little neck of land joining the two countries, past Central
America, which the little girl insisted made three
Americas. She had listened to the tales of the early
explorers and their cruel lust for gold until she had
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jason, are you going for gold in California,
and will the people murder whole nations and rob
them? I would rather not have the gold."</p>

<p>"No, my little girl; and the country that has the
gold belongs to us. But it has many other delightful
things as well. It is not like bleak Maine."</p>

<p>"What a strange journey it has been, and oh, how
beautiful most of the time. I do not believe I shall
ever be afraid of storms again."</p>

<p>"You have made a most excellent sailor. It will
seem queer to be on land again. You will keep your
sea legs for some time to come."</p>

<p>"Sea legs?" She laughed inquiringly.</p>

<p>"The faculty one acquires of walking with the roll
of the ship. Sailors always do it on land. And you
will see that you have an inclination to go from side to
side as if the street was hardly wide enough;" and he
looked at her out of humorous eyes.</p>

<p>He had a way of nearly shutting one eye, which
gave an absolutely funny expression to his face. He
had buffeted so many storms and narrow escapes that
he looked fully ten years beyond his age, which was
but thirty-five. He had a tall, vigorous frame, with a
little stoop in the shoulders and a way of sitting down
all in a heap. The little girl told him he made a cave
for her to sit in. Every day she loved him more dearly,
and to him she was the one thing that brightened his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
way and gave him new aims. He had been going to
California simply to see a strange and new land. He
had not been won by the wonderful tales of gold, he
had cared very little for wealth. But now he would
make a fortune for her and have it so safely invested
that she should not come to want if she lived to be
old. He could never forget the afternoon he had
come to Laverne Westbury's home, that she had been
warned to leave in the spring, and found her
almost on the verge of starvation, too proud to keep
asking charity, worn out and disheartened, with only
the county house looming before her. Little Verne
should never know this, never suffer as her mother
had done.</p>

<p>And this was one reason he led her thoughts away
from the old life. She was too young to know that he
had loved her mother, she took the relationship for
granted. And even on the long voyage there had been
so much to entertain her. The only child on board,
and a winsome one at that, she had been a universal
favorite; and Jason Chadsey hardly less so. The trio,
as the three single women had been dubbed, though
the married ones often said "the old maids," after a
little, established very friendly relations with Mr. Chadsey.
Miss Holmes was past thirty, and had worn herself
almost out teaching school. A sea voyage had
been prescribed to avoid consumption, that scourge of
the eastern towns. She had gained in health and
strength, and certainly in looks. When she found the
little girl and her uncle poring over their old map, she
brought out some of her school books, to Laverne's
great delight. Among them was the story of the Argonauts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
that caught the young imagination, and even
Dick Folsom became interested in the various explorers
who had dreamed of gold and of the straight route to
China. Miss Gaines had been a dressmaker until a
troublesome pain in her side warned her to seek a
different occupation, and Miss Alwood had kept house,
done nursing, and they had planned to make better
fortunes in the new country, where there were fewer
women. Mrs. Dawson was going out to meet her
husband, who had been among the "Forty-miners," and
now kept a sort of lodging ranch, that with her help
could be transformed into a regular hotel, much in
demand at that time.</p>

<p>And so they had made quite a little colony on shipboard.
Slowly they came up the Pacific Coast, past
the long peninsula of Southern California, and there,
fairly in sight, was the Golden Gate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
OLD SAN FRANCISCO</h2>

<p>Was it any wonder the old explorers missed the narrow
outlet from the great bay when the hills from the
farther shore cast a great gloomy shadow, and dreary
rocks flanked the shore, inhabited by cormorants and
auks and gulls, screaming out their discordant music?
What if the tide did run out sweeping like a torrent&mdash;were
they going to breast the danger back of it? Was
the great rocky point worth their consideration? In
the islands off the shore seals and sea lions had it all
their own way and basked and frolicked in the sunshine.</p>

<p>It had changed then, in the early fifties, but half a
century has almost forgotten the bareness of it then.
And yet it was magnificent in the October sunset as
the old ship made its way, puffing from the strains of
its long journey. They had nearly all huddled on deck
to view their land of promise. There are few enthusiastic
emigrants now, everything is viewed with commercial
eyes. Afar to the westward stretched the magnificent
ocean, a sheet of billowy ranges tipped with
molten gold, changing to a hundred iridescent tints
and throwing up the gold again in prodigal fashion,
sweeping it over to foreign seas. And, on the other
hand, the mile-wide gap, the gateway to the wonderful
land, tranquil enough now, with frowning rocks like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the cave of Scylla on the one hand, that was to be
transformed into a wonderful city. They are piloted
through to the great magnificent bay that seems endless
at the first glance of its seventy miles. Northward
long lines of rolling hills, purple and blue and black,
with glints of the setting sun fighting the shadows like
some strange old gods with their fire-tipped arrows.
At the south it fades into misty dreamland. Red Rock
stands up defiant. And so they look at their new
country and then at each other. There is shipping at
the rude wharves, and they find a place to anchor,
but it is too late to look for a home and so they make
themselves content. But if they thought they were
coming to great space, and semi-loneliness they were
mistaken and confused by the noise and tumult, the
crowds, the bustle of business, the people of all countries
it seemed.</p>

<p>"Why, I had no idea," the women said to one another.
"The place must be overcrowded."</p>

<p>What chance was there then for women who had
come to seek their fortunes?</p>

<p>They soon found that San Francisco was the stopping
place of nearly every nation, and yet there was
room for more, and work for those willing to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson came down to meet his wife the next
morning, and was made acquainted with the little party
that had become such friends in their long journey.</p>

<p>"We can take some of you in if you will accept the
accommodations," he said cordially. "They might be
worse," with a shrug of the shoulders. "Luckily, I
escaped being burnt out. Will you come and take a
view of our town?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>What an odd place it was, built on the hills like
Rome. On the ocean side great frowning rocks that
suggested fortresses. At the extreme end, the highest
of hills, the city began, and it spread out over little
valleys and other hills, sloping to the busy, beautiful
bay. And it seemed right in the heart of it lay devastation,
débris and ashes. Hundreds of men were clearing,
laying foundations again, rearing new structures.</p>

<p>"It was an awful fire," explained their guide. "We
had thought fireproof bricks and iron-bound structures
would at least stay the devastating hand of destruction,
and even that proved useless. But for the loss one
might have enjoyed the magnificent spectacle of the
immense fiery field. The fierce roar of the flames,
the shouts and shrieks of the flying people, the glowing
crackling mass sending spires up to the very sky, it
seemed, was something we shall never forget. It was
said to have been visible a hundred miles away."</p>

<p>The ruins were startling even now. Then the party
turned, crossed Market Street and came into Spear
Street. Here there was a rambling frame building
that had been added to several times, two stories for
the most part, but a long ell of only one story. The
main end bore the name of "Dawson House." It
was not a hotel, and had no bar, that usual accompaniment.
Round in the next street, Mr. Dawson had
a clubhouse that supplied this want, and all games of
chance, but this place was of the better sort.</p>

<p>The Farnsworths had gone to friends only a few
squares from the wharf. Mr. Dawson made friends
at once with young Folsom and offered him a position.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm in for the gold fields," he declared with boyish
eagerness.</p>

<p>"You'd better consider a day or two," suggested
his mother.</p>

<p>"And I'll take the mother, too, if she is as good a
housekeeper as she looks to be," Mr. Dawson subjoined
laughingly. "If I don't, young fellow, some man will
snap your mother up before you'll have a chance to
see the color of his eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, here are four husbandless women," she retorted
gayly. "He could have a choice."</p>

<p>They were ushered into a spacious room with a
painted floor and nondescript furnishing. In one
corner was a large desk at which sat a clerk. This
opened into a dining room, in which the long
table was seldom without a guest. Several were
seated there now. On the other side were two
smaller rooms tolerably well furnished, one a sleeping
chamber.</p>

<p>"You'll find we're suffering from the want of
woman's hands and woman's wit. I could hardly believe
my wife had consented to come. You see those
who are worth anything are soon offered homes of
their own, and the others&mdash;&mdash;" He made a peculiar
little gesture, that elicited a shrewd smile from Jason
Chadsey.</p>

<p>It was comforting to find a place of refuge so soon,
they all thought. On the second floor were lodging
rooms for the better class. The ell was fitted up with
rows of bunks, and there was seldom a vacancy by midnight.</p>

<p>Laverne kept tight hold of Uncle Jason's hand, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
when Mr. Dawson smiled over to her, half hid her face
on Uncle Jason's ample frame.</p>

<p>"Are we all going to live here?" she asked in a low
tone.</p>

<p>"For a little while, I think. We would not want
to go away alone. And there must be some one to
keep the house when I get one."</p>

<p>"But you know that I helped mother, oh, for a
long while. Sometimes I chopped up the wood. And
in the autumn I dug the potatoes and husked the corn,
but we had to kill the poor hens, after all," and she
sighed. "I swept up the house, too. Oh, I can do a
great many things."</p>

<p>He took the slim little hand in his and tried to smile
over her eagerness, but his heart ached as he thought
of her mother, and the hardships he could not save.</p>

<p>"Will it be winter soon?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Not a Maine winter, my child. I believe there
is no real winter."</p>

<p>"Everything looks queer and dried up, yet it isn't
cold. And what a great city, it is almost as large as
New York."</p>

<p>He laughed at that, then he was grave a moment.
"It may be as great, some day. The Pacific will be a
big rival to the Atlantic."</p>

<p>"To think we are clear over here! Why don't they
build a railroad&mdash;just so?" and she made a mark with
her small finger.</p>

<p>"No doubt that will come also."</p>

<p>They made arrangements about staying for the present.
It seemed queer to the child that the friend she
had known so long should be Mr. Dawson's wife. Already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
she was giving some orders and telling what she
wanted done, and did not seem a bit afraid of the portly
man who could speak so sharply to the Chinese servants.</p>

<p>Laverne thought them very odd. She had only seen
pictures of them before. They walked so softly in
their pointed slippers, and looked a little like women in
their loose blue shirts with hanging sleeves. The long
queue twisted around their heads, and their slanting
eyes seemed weird enough.</p>

<p>She saw many other queer people in their walk back
to the boat. Uncle Jason thought it too long, but she
pleaded so to go. There were other curious dark-eyed
and dark-skinned men, small and bright Japanese she
came to know, and tall Spaniards in picturesque attire
with handsome sashes about their waists; Indians, too,
and a group of squaws girt about with blankets, two
carrying their babies on their backs, and these made her
think of the Maine clear across the continent, for you
occasionally saw them there.</p>

<p>The old vessel seemed almost like home to her.
They gathered up their luggage and that belonging to
the ladies and ordered it sent to the Dawson House.
Then they went up on Telegraph Hill, and half the
world seemed spread out before them. The sun was
shining in well-nigh blinding brilliancy. There was
the narrow passageway that hardly looked its real
width, there was the northern peninsula, Mount Tamalpais,
Belvidere, Sausalito, and all the places she was
to come to know so well. And there over the bay were
the low spurs of the Coast Range, at whose feet were
to spring up towns and cities. The bay looked to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
like a smaller ocean. But boats were plying back and
forth. And they could see the other hills about, and
the town spreading here and there outside of the
burned district.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said she was very tired, and her steps
lagged a little. Uncle Jason would have been glad to
carry her, he had occasionally carried greater burdens
in times of peril, but that would be hardly admissible,
they were going downhill too, which was easier.
She had not seen all the strange people yet, for they
met a group of Portuguese sailors with big hoop earrings,
who were gesticulating fiercely, and some Russians
with high caps and black, bushy beards. She
was glad she had studied so much geography on shipboard,
and she began to feel quite wise about different
countries.</p>

<p>When she reached their present home she begged
that she might go to bed. She did not want to eat
even a tempting bit of cake. Mrs. Dawson took her
into her room and put a pillow on the lounge, and
while the others talked and planned she slept
soundly.</p>

<p>"What a pretty child she is," Mr. Dawson said.
"You will have to watch her closely that no one steals
her."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Uncle Jason said thoughtfully. But in this
wild, bustling life few would want to be burdened with
a child not belonging to them.</p>

<p>When Laverne woke there was a queer, rushing,
rustling sound, and it was dark like twilight. Where
was she? What was happening? Then she sprang
up and remembered. The ladies were talking in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
next room. Oh, it rained and the wind seemed blowing
a gale.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a nice sleep you have had!" exclaimed
Mrs. Dawson. "And now you must be hungry, though
we shall have dinner in a very short time. You look
rested," and she smiled cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. I don't know what made me so tired."
She had not climbed a hill in a long while.</p>

<p>"We didn't have any hills to climb on shipboard, and
in all these months we did get out of practice," said
Miss Holmes. "I was tired as well. And now the
rainy season has begun, and Mr. Dawson has been saying
that in a week or two the country will look like
spring."</p>

<p>"And won't there be any winter? Though I don't
like winter very much," she added naïvely. "Only the
sledding and skating."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care to live in Maine," and Miss Gaines
gave a little shiver. "All my life I have longed for a
warm winter climate. And if this doesn't suit, I shall
go further south."</p>

<p>"You women without husbands are very independent,"
laughed Mrs. Dawson.</p>

<p>"You certainly can go where you like if you have
money enough to take you there," was the reply.
"Verne, come sit here and tell me if you like San
Francisco as well as the ship and the voyage."</p>

<p>"It's queer and such lots of queer people, and how
they can understand each other I can't see, for they
all seem to talk different. I'd rather not live on a ship
all my life."</p>

<p>"Then do not marry a sea captain. But your uncle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
may take a fancy to go to China or Japan. It is not so
far from here. Grace, have you written any letters
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Miss Alwood. "I think my friends
will not be immediately alarmed."</p>

<p>"And this little girl has left no relatives behind, I
heard her uncle say. Haven't you any cousins?"</p>

<p>"My mother had no brothers or sisters." Then she
remembered how little she had ever heard about her
father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawson brushed her hair and they were summoned
to dinner. They had the upper end of the table.
Two other women came in with their husbands.
There were some Spaniards among the men, and a few
very dark, peculiar-looking people. There was a great
deal of talking in tongues unknown to the little girl,
but some of the voices had a soft, musical sound.</p>

<p>The little girl was really hungry and enjoyed her
dinner. Afterward most of the party played cards.
The other lodgers were of the commoner sort, had a
dining room to themselves, and generally sallied out in
the evening. Fights were not infrequent and the
harmless phases of games degenerated into gambling.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes had not mastered the art even on the
long voyage. She took Laverne under her wing
now.</p>

<p>"You and I will have to learn Spanish," she said.
"Once Spain owned all this country."</p>

<p>"And will we have to learn all the other talk? I
know some Indian words, there were two old Indian
women in our town, and in the summer some of the
tribes would come down. But Chinese&mdash;that funny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
reading that comes on tea chests&mdash;&mdash;" and a knot gathered
in her forehead.</p>

<p>"We will not take Chinese the first. I have a
friend who went out as a missionary and who can talk
it fluently. But all down along the coast it is settled
by Spaniards, and they were in South America, you
know, and it seems as if half the people here were talking
it. Then it is a stately and beautiful language.
You know you learned some French on shipboard."</p>

<p>"And there are so many things to learn. There
were so few in our little place. They spun and knit
and sewed, and you made bed quilts in case you were
married. Mother had two she had never used, and a
great counterpane grandmother had knit."</p>

<p>"Yes. It is a pity they couldn't have been saved
for you. I have a chest of heirlooms stored in the
house of a cousin at Dorchester, and some Revolutionary
relics. My grandfather fought in the war. And
I have left them all behind."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes gave a little sighing laugh. She could
not tell whether she was glad or sorry that she had
taken this long journey to a strange land.</p>

<p>"What did Spain want of America?" queried the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you remember how they came to Mexico
for the gold. There was Pizarro and Cortez&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And poor Montezuma in South America. Are
there any real gold mines here?"</p>

<p>"Not just in the town."</p>

<p>"Then no one will come and fight us and take the
gold away," she said with a sigh of relief.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Jason gave a dry smile. There was fighting
enough, he had found already.</p>

<p>"Would you care for the gold?" The child raised
soft, inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I should like to have a share of it. But
I do not think I shall go and work in the mines."</p>

<p>"Did they fight very much at the fort. And who
did they drive away?" she asked in a rather awe-stricken
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, my child, they did not fight at all. The country
belonged to us. The gold was free for any one
willing to mine. We shall see the men coming in with
their bags of gold dust and nuggets, and though they
may talk fiercely and quarrel, they need not disturb
us," and Miss Holmes smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jason will not go," she said confidently,
after quite a pause. Then she glanced over to him and
smiled, and was answered in return.</p>

<p>He lost that trick and the next and Mrs. Dawson
won his money. It did well enough to play for fun on
shipboard, the captain had strictly forbidden gambling,
but here one would not dream of such a thing. The
stakes were not high, however.</p>

<p>He was thinking of his little girl and whether he had
done wisely to bring her here. He had planned
this journey before he knew whether the little girl
was dead or alive; at any rate he had supposed she
would be in the keeping of her own father. And the
pitiful story of the woman he had loved, and would
have slaved for had she been his, had roused all the
chivalrous feelings of his nature. And that she should
give him the child who had her smile and her soft, appealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
voice, and the pretty eagerness that had
cropped out now and then, though it was the fashion
to repress it, seemed so wonderful and so sacred to
him, and occupied so much of his thoughts that he
never dreamed of altering his plans, or whether they
would be best for her. Everything was so different,
such a hurly-burly, that he wondered if a little girl
could be brought up clean and wholesome and happy.
A touch of uncertainty was creeping through every
nerve. A man's life was so different. And there
must be some one to guard her since he had to make
the fortune for her. Would Miss Holmes do? They
had become great friends. Then Miss Holmes had
the Eastern refinement and uprightness.</p>

<p>He had not counted on sharing her with any one,
his ideas had been vague and impractical and he would
have to remodel them.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, I never knew you to play so
poorly," laughed Mrs. Dawson teasingly; "I believe
you are half asleep."</p>

<p>"I think that must be it. I am a landlubber to-night,
so I beg you to excuse me," and he rose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
MAKING A NEW HOME</h2>

<p>It rained three days, not quite like sullen Eastern
storms, but in gusts and showers. At times the wind
drove it along like a trampling army, then the fog came
up and you could hardly see anything but the vaguest
outlines. The rainy season had set in.</p>

<p>"Will it rain all the time?" asked Laverne. "And
I have no rubbers."</p>

<p>"That is a sad oversight. I don't believe you will
find any small ones here," answered Mrs. Dawson.
"But I have interviewed some of the old residents, and
they say it only rains by spells, but that the spells are
rather frequent. I suppose we shall get used to it."</p>

<p>It was mid-forenoon. Laverne had asked questions
about everything she could imagine, and heard many
wonderful stories. The convent tales interested her
deeply. They had found an old volume of the early
days, and she had rejoiced in the legend of Father
Francis, who had been left out of the list of missions
that were to be named after the Saints.</p>

<p>"And no St. Francis!" cried the good missionary,
surprised at such neglect. "Is not our own dear
Father Francis to have a mission assigned to him?"</p>

<p>The visitador replied loftily, "If St. Francis wishes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
a mission let him show you a good port and it shall
bear his name."</p>

<p>They had been discouraged at the rough shores and
rocky heights. But they went on and suddenly the
gateway opened before them, and the bay came in view.
So they entered it, and while they were waiting for the
storeship, they cut down timber and began to make a
settlement on a fertile plain surrounded by vine-clad
hills. When the storeship arrived with cattle, provisions,
and some more emigrants, they built some plain
houses, and the mission, and on the day of St. Francis
it was blessed and consecrated with a Mass, and for
music they had a continual discharge of firearms, while
the smoke answered for incense. Then they set about
converting the natives who were poor, wandering clans
with no religion, but a great fear of sorcerers, and
were very easily managed. And now the Mission
de los Dolores was but a crumbling ruin, while the
good St. Francis lives in the noble name of bay and
city.</p>

<p>Then there was the pathetic story of Doña Conceptione,
daughter of the Commandant of Presidio. A
Russian official visited it, and fell deeply in love with
the beautiful girl. But he not only had to return with
business matters, but had to lay before the Czar his
earnest wish to espouse his sweetheart. Doña Conceptione
waited at first in great joy and hope, but no
word and no lover came. When her father tried to
win her from her love by various devices, she would
not be comforted with them. Many a time she looked
longingly over the ocean, straining her eyes to see the
vague outline of his ship that never came, and so her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
sweet youth passed, her beauty began to fade, but she
would not give up her faith. He was dead, or he
would have come. He could not prove false. She
went into a convent and prayed for his soul's rest.
Long afterward she heard he had been killed on his
way home, and her sad heart was comforted by the
thought that she had never doubted his love.</p>

<p>And then another beautiful girl, whose lover had
gone to battle with a fierce tribe of Indians who had
attacked one of the lower missions. His horse had
found its way back unharmed, and some one who had
seen him fall brought back his bloody scarf and his
jewelled dagger, picked up from the ground, but the
Indians had mutilated his body horribly and cast it
away in fragments. When Doña Eustacia recovered
from her long illness she would take the veil in spite
of her mother's protests, for there was another lover
the elder had preferred. And so two years passed
away when a poor, dishevelled, footsore man came
back, who had not been killed but wounded and taken
prisoner, and at last managed to escape. And when the
Señor Roldan learned Eustacia's sorrowful mistake he
begged that she be released from her vows, and proffered
his estate to the mission for her. But the Padre
was obdurate and would not listen. Did some bird
carry messages to her? There was no need to pray
for his soul, and his faithful love was too sweet to give
up. So the little bird comforted her, and though she
knew she was perilling her soul's salvation she slipped
out of the convent one night, and her lover lifted her
on his horse and they went away in the storm and the
darkness, whither no one ever knew, but the Padre took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
his estate, and they were both laid under the ban of the
Church.</p>

<p>"But did it really hurt them?" queried the young
listener.</p>

<p>"I should like to think they were very happy," declared
Miss Holmes, closing the book, "and we will
end it that way."</p>

<p>"Do see!" cried Laverne, running to the window.
"Why, it is yellow and purple, and rolling up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The fog is lifting. And the sun is coming out,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>"The cobwebs being swept from the sky," laughed
the child. "But there is no old woman with a
broom."</p>

<p>Yes, there was the sun out in all its glory, driving
the fog into the ocean, tearing it into tatters, and suddenly
everything was glorified. The evergreens had
been washed free from dust and were in their metallic
tints, other foliage that had seemed brown a few days
ago, glowed and shimmered in the crystal-clear air.
The change was marvellous. The newcomers glanced
at each other in surprise, with no words to express
their exhilaration.</p>

<p>"And now we can go out!" cried Laverne. "I
want to climb a hill."</p>

<p>Uncle Jason laughed. "Come and see," he replied.</p>

<p>Alas! Rivulets were running down the slopes and
the wind was appalling. Some of the streets were
simply seas meandering along.</p>

<p>"Never mind, to-morrow it will be nice and you will
see it dry up by magic."</p>

<p>Laverne went back to the book of legends and stories.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
The others had been considering plans. Mrs. Folsom
had accepted Mr. Dawson's proposal and was installed
as housekeeper to his wife's great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It would be folly for a young fellow like you to go
out to the mines," Mr. Dawson said to Richard.
"There's gold enough to last ten years or I'll miss
my guess. It's no place for a boy. And there is
plenty to do right here. I'll take you as a clerk."</p>

<p>"We certainly have fallen in a clover bed," exclaimed
his mother; "I don't know how to thank you."</p>

<p>"I guess I need you as much as you need me. And
if the boy keeps honest and upright and doesn't take
to gambling his fortune is made."</p>

<p>"But I shall go to the gold fields in the end," Dick
said to his mother. She was satisfied to have it put
off a while.</p>

<p>The rain had not kept Jason Chadsey in the house.
He had gone on several inspecting tours. There was
work to be had everywhere. Building up the burned
district, draying around the bay in every conceivable
branch. Every week dozens of men threw up a job
and started for the gold fields. Three or four shipping
houses almost fought for him when they learned
he was a Maine man, and had been half over the world,
was indeed full of shrewd knowledge that had been
discriminated by a wide experience, and neither drank
nor gambled, the besetting sins of those early days.</p>

<p>Then there was the home. Miss Alwood had found
a position. The other two had been friends for years.
A needlewoman would readily gain employment, and
no doubt teachers would be in demand.</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey ruminated over the matter. Women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
had hardly begun to make homes for themselves in
that chaotic region. What if he made a home for them
both and Miss Holmes took care of Laverne? The
child was very fond of her.</p>

<p>He went about the matter in a straightforward
fashion. Miss Holmes accepted at once. She had begun
to wonder a little at her temerity in seeking her
fortune in this new land. In the older cities it was
different. And she had a motherly heart for Laverne.
Indeed, if Jason Chadsey had offered her marriage she
would have accepted it readily, though it would have
been based on respect and friendship.</p>

<p>"You will be head of the interior," he said, in a
rather humorous tone. "We may find some one to do
the rough part. And if Miss Gaines would like to
make her home with you we shall be a cheerful and
comfortable family, I fancy."</p>

<p>It was not so easy to find a domicile ready made.
Too many of the houses, even among those offered
for sale, were flimsy things and held at exorbitant
prices. But he struck one presently. The man's wife
had died and he wanted to go to the mines, but did not
really care to sell. He would rent furniture and all
for six months.</p>

<p>The Dawsons were sorry to have them leave. To
be sure, their places could be filled easily enough, but
they had all been so friendly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the weather would have been amusing if
it had not been so trying. It had come off very hot,
and the north wind seemed to be bringing gusts from
the desert that scorched the green things with its
withering fury. The stars shone out pitiless like lesser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
suns. Then splendid revivifying showers, and air as
balmy as spring, laden with wafts of curious fragrance,
touching the hillsides with magic, clothing them with
daintiest verdure. Was this winter? Were not the
seasons absolutely lost?</p>

<p>The little girl was as much interested in the house as
if she had been a decade older. It was rather out of
the business region, and built on a side hill. Downstairs,
even with the street in front, which had a narrow
plank sidewalk, there were two rooms; on the
next floor four, and you stepped out on the level again
at the back. There was a flat rock, then another declivity,
but not so steep. Up here there was a magnificent
prospect. A little shrubbery grew about, but
it was mostly a tangle of vines, where flowers were to
run riot in the spring.</p>

<p>It was quite as plain as the little cottage in the Maine
town though much less substantial. Sometimes in a
strong west wind it seemed as if it might slide to the
street below. But houses seldom blew about that
way.</p>

<p>Outside a series of rude steps had been laid. Now
and then they washed out in a heavy rain, but they
could be relaid without much trouble, and sometimes
the sticky clay hardened like stone and they remained
for a long while. She liked to run up and down them,
flying like a gull, stretching out her small arms, to the
terror of Miss Holmes.</p>

<p>"You will slip some day and break your neck or
some of your limbs, and your uncle will think I was
careless about you," she said anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will tell him that you were always cautioning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
me. And I do not believe I shall break easily,"
laughing with a child's glee.</p>

<p>Every day changed her it seemed. Her eyes glowed
with quivering lights like the bay, her cheeks rounded
out, the dimple grew deeper and held a pink tint like
the heart of a rose. Uncle Jason put uncounted kisses
in it. She would be prettier than her mother, and that
gave him a jealous pang. Her father had been esteemed
good-looking, but really she was not like him.
The coloring and hair resembled her mother's. Ah, if
she could be here amid the splendor, and he shuddered,
thinking of the bleak little town.</p>

<p>The housekeeping was not arduous. Even in those
early days fruits were abundant and vegetables enough
to surprise one. Then Jason Chadsey went away in
the morning and oftener took his lunch at the Dawsons',
not coming home until night. Everything in a
business way rushed.</p>

<p>There were schools already, for the American plants
his schoolhouse if there are a dozen children. They
could see the one down on the Plaza. There were
churches, too. Even in 1848 there had been Sunday
worship established on the Plaza, and a year later, in
spite of all the hubbub, churches were really organized.
Then they erected a substantial tent on Dupont Street,
until one of their members ordered a church ready to
be put together, from New York. There was beside
a Congregational Society and this attracted Miss
Holmes, for she had always been "orthodox" in Boston.
But the long sea voyage and the lawless life all
about her were rather demoralizing.</p>

<p>Men and women broadened out, sharp corners of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
creeds were rubbed off. There was a very earnest endeavor
among the better classes for the extension of
higher moral purposes, and a purer rule, and all of that
mind worked heartily together.</p>

<p>Marian Holmes was much interested in her friend's
welfare. Miss Gaines, with true Yankee faculty, was
meaning to make a place for herself and some money.
Her heart yearned for the intelligence and order of
her native city.</p>

<p>"I shall not spend all my life in this riotous, disorderly
place where you cannot tell what will happen
to you next. Like the men, I want to make some
money. It doesn't take so very much to be comfortable
in Boston, and there are all the appliances and
enjoyments of civilization. I was talking to that Mrs.
Latham who has come to the Dawsons for a few weeks
while their house is being finished. And she recommends
that I shall start an establishment at once, while
I am new to the town."</p>

<p>Miss Gaines studied her compeer. She had been
talking so rapidly she was out of breath.</p>

<p>"Well?" as Miss Holmes was silent.</p>

<p>"Why, it might be an excellent thing. Only could
you get girls to sew? I do not think the young women
are of that type. They flock to the restaurants."</p>

<p>"There are two Catholic women Mrs. Latham spoke
of&mdash;you know their priests keep stricter watch over
them. They are of the old Spanish Californian stock.
They have sewed for her and are neat as new pins, but
have no style. They rent out the lower floor of their
house, being in straitened circumstances. Their tenant
is to go next week, I believe I shall take the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
rooms, and open a shop, emporium, establishment,
whatever it is best to call it. They will work for me.
And the more bizarre clothes are made the better. I
think they will suit these people, who do not care how
they spend their money if it is so their neighbors can
see it. Then we will all be provided for. Though I
think I could have had an offer of marriage last night.
A man had just come in from the mines with a pile of
gold. He was a Boston man, but sadly demoralized
by drink. I felt sorry for him at first, then disgusted."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes laughed. "And thereby missed a
chance that it is supposed no woman lets slip."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall not take a chance like that. Come
with me to see the rooms."</p>

<p>"I must find Laverne. The child grows wild as
the wildest thing in town, and yet she is sweet as a rose.
There's something in the air that sets all your blood
astir. I have not danced for years. I should like to
dance. I feel curiously young."</p>

<p>"Marian Holmes! You are in love! But I can't
imagine Jason Chadsey dancing. Though you are not
compelled to dance with your husband in this lawless
place."</p>

<p>"I am afraid it would be love's labor lost if that were
the case. He like you has his heart set on making
money, but for the child."</p>

<p>She ran out and looked at Table Rock, as they called
a large, flattish boulder. Laverne was not there.
Then she glanced around. Some distance down the
street was a group of little girls, but Laverne's light
hair made her distinctive. She walked a short distance
and then called.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>The child hesitated, and the call was repeated.
Laverne came with the rush of a wild deer.</p>

<p>"Oh, can't I stay a little longer? I'm telling them
about Maine, and the snows and coasting. And it
doesn't snow here, at least only a little bit. They are
such nice girls, and I am so lonely with only big folks.
They talk Spanish and very broken English."</p>

<p>"I want to take you out. Your uncle wouldn't like
me to leave you among strangers."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we're not strangers now. We know each
other's names. Carmencita,&mdash;isn't that pretty,&mdash;and
Juana, and Anesta, and their voices are so soft, and
such black eyes as they have!"</p>

<p>"But you must come with me, dear," and there was
a firmness in Miss Holmes' tone.</p>

<p>The child looked irresolute. "Well, I must tell
them," and she was off again. These walks about the
city always interested her. She made amends by
promising to come in the afternoon.</p>

<p>There was not much regularity in the streets save
in the business section. Some were little better than
alleyways, others wound about, and like most new
places, houses had been set anywhere, but there were
a few pretty spots belonging to some of the older settlers
before the irruption of the horde. And already
the Chinese had congregated together, the Germans
had a settlement, and the American was everywhere.</p>

<p>This was really a pretty nook, with some wild olive
trees about and almonds, while grape vines clambered
over the rocks. It had been quite a fine estate, but its
day was past. At one end was the adobe cottage of
two stories, with a flat roof and small deep-set windows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
that made it look like the spur of a mission. At
the southern end was a great open porch, the adobe
floor stained a dullish red, and vines were climbing
over the columns. The little garden in front had some
vegetables growing in it.</p>

<p>The Señora Vanegas came down the outside stairs,
she had seen the guests from her window. She spoke
quite brokenly, falling into Spanish when she was at
loss for a word. Then she called her daughter Jacintha,
who had mastered English, but spoke it with a
charming accent, and translated into Spanish that her
mother more readily understood the desire of the
visitors. Mrs. Latham had sent them. Yes, they
knew Mrs. Latham very well. Oh, it would be charming
to have some one to take the lead, they did not
profess to understand all the art of costuming. But
Jacintha brought down some exquisite embroidery and
drawn work, and the mother made cushion lace for
some of the big ladies. Her brother, it seemed, had
owned the whole estate, which had come from their
father, and drank and gambled it away, keeping racing
horses. Only this little spot was left to them, and they
were very poor. The mother would gladly retire to a
convent, but the daughters&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I could not like the life," Jacintha protested.
"Perhaps, when I am old and have had no lovers, I
might be willing. But while I can work, and the
world is so bright," smiling with youth and hope.</p>

<p>"All three of you&mdash;&mdash;" inquired the mother.</p>

<p>"Only Miss Gaines," explained Jacintha. "The
others have a home, and Miss Gaines will go there on
Sunday. Oh, Señorita, you will find plenty of work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and we will be glad to help. And it will be a great
interest."</p>

<p>The mother brought in a plate of crispy spiced
cakes, and some sweet wine of berries that she always
prepared. For berries grew almost everywhere, even
if they were not of the choicest kind. A little cultivation
worked wonders.</p>

<p>So that was settled. They all went to Dawson
House and had luncheon. Mrs. Dawson was really in
her glory.</p>

<p>"I was a fool that I didn't come out before," she
said, with her heartsome laugh. "Several of my
cousins went West and suffered everything, and I had
no taste for emigrating. So I said to Dawson when he
was smitten with the gold craze, 'Go out and make
some money, and get a home to keep me in, and a
servant to wait upon me, and then I will come.' But I
might as well have been here a year ago. There is
money to be paid for everything, no one haggles over
the price. So, Miss Gaines, we will wish you success
and a fortune."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your hand in it;" and Miss Gaines
nodded merrily.</p>

<p>"Hillo!" cried a bright voice, as Laverne stood
talking to the beautiful big dog in the hall. "Why,
I've not seen you for ever so long. Where have you
been?"</p>

<p>"Home&mdash;I suppose that's home over there," and she
nodded her head, while the dimple in her cheek deepened.
"But it is all so queer. Well, when you are
over on the other side of the world,&mdash;turned upside
down"&mdash;&mdash;and she looked half funny, half perplexed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you homesick? Do you want to go back to
Maine?"</p>

<p>"But there isn't any one to care for me there," she
said a little sadly. "Uncle Jason's all I have. It's
so queer for winter, though. No snow, no sliding, no
skating, no fun at snowballing. And between the rains
things spring up and grow. I've tamed two funny
little squirrels, so one of them will eat out of my hand.
And the birds come to be fed."</p>

<p>"You can see snow enough up on the mountain-tops.
It never melts away. I like the fun and stir
and strange people. It makes you believe in Sir Francis
Drake and the pirates and everything. But my!
how they spend money and gamble it away! I hope
your uncle will have a level head and hold on to what
he gets."</p>

<p>"I've found three Spanish girls that are just lovely.
There are so few little girls about," in a rather melancholy
tone. "And Miss Holmes teaches me at home.
I'd rather go to school, but it's too far, and uncle says
wait until I get older."</p>

<p>"I guess that's best," returned the experienced
youth. "Sometimes it is hardly safe for a little girl
in the street. There are so many drunken rowdies."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never do go out alone, except over at the
cedars. They are sort of scrubby and look like Maine.
The little girls live there. I don't quite like their
mother; she has such sharp black eyes. Why do you
suppose so many people have black eyes?"</p>

<p>Dick considered a moment. "Why, the tropical nations
are darker, and the Mexicans, and those queer
people from Hawaii and all the islands over yonder.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Your uncle will know all about them. When I am a
few years older I mean to travel. I'll go up to the gold
fields and make a pile, and you bet I won't come in
town and gamble it away in a single night, the way
some of them do. I'll go over to Australia and China."</p>

<p>Laverne drew a long breath. What a wonderful
world it was! If she could be suddenly dropped down
into the small district school and tell them all she had
seen!</p>

<p>Some one called Dick. She sauntered back into the
room, but the women were still talking business and
clothes. There was a beautiful big hound who looked
at her with wistful eyes, and she spoke to him. He
nodded and looked gravely wise.</p>

<p>"You've a most uncompromising name," Mrs.
Latham was saying. "You can't seem to Frenchify
the beginning nor end. You must put a card in the
paper." For the newspaper had been a necessity from
the very first, and the <i>Alta Californian</i> was eagerly
scanned.</p>

<p>"Yes," Miss Gaines returned, "Calista Gaines. It
has a sound of the old Bay State. Well, I'm not
ashamed of it," almost defiantly.</p>

<p>"And we shall have to get most of our fashions
from the States for some time to come. We are not
in the direct line from Paris. And I really don't see
why we shouldn't have fashions of our own. Here
are the picturesque Spanish garments that can be
adapted. Oh, you will do, and we shall be glad enough
to have you," giving a most hearty and encouraging
laugh.</p>

<p>"Fortune-making is in the very air," declared Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Gaines on the homeward way. "Well, I think I like a
new, energetic country. And what a delicious voice
that Jacintha has! I wonder if voices do not get toned
down in this air. Our east wind is considered bad for
them. And it is said a foggy air is good for the complexion.
We may end by being rich and beautiful,
who knows!"</p>

<p>Laverne ran out to look after her squirrels, and chattered
with them. Then something bright caught her
eye up among the tangles of vines and shrubs. Why,
flowers, absolutely in bloom in December! She gathered
a handful of them and hurried back overjoyed.</p>

<p>"Oh, see, see!" she cried, out of breath. "They
are up here on the hill, and everything is growing.
Isn't it queer! Do you suppose the real winter will
come in July?"</p>

<p>"If stories are true we will hardly have any winter
at all," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And they are all snowed up in Maine. Oh, I
wish there was some one to write me a letter."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
A QUEER WINTER</h2>

<p>Christmas and New Year's brought a mad whirl.
All that could, came in from the mines. The streets
were thronged. Banjo and guitar were thrummed to
the songs and choruses of the day, and even the accordion
notes floated out on the air, now soft and pathetic
with "Annie Laurie", "Home, Sweet Home," and
"There's Nae Luck About the House," "The Girl I
Left Behind Me," or a jolly song from fine male
voices. Then there were balls, and a great masquerade,
until it seemed as if there was nothing to life but
pleasure.</p>

<p>Miss Gaines came in with some of the stories. But
the most delightful were those of the three little Estenega
girls about the Christmas eve at the church and
the little child Jesus in the cradle, the wise men bringing
their gifts, the small plain chapel dressed with
greens and flowers in Vallejo Street. Laverne had not
been brought up to Christmas services and at first was
quite shocked. But the child's heart warmed to the
thought, and Miss Holmes read the simple story of
Bethlehem in Judea, that touched her immeasurably.</p>

<p>And then there seemed a curious awakening of
spring. Flowers sprang up and bloomed as if the rain
had a magic that it scattered with every drop. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
atmosphere had a startling transparency. There were
the blue slopes of Tamalpais, and far away in the San
Matteo Range the redwood trees stood up in their
magnificence. Out through the Golden Gate one could
discern the Farallones forty miles away. The very
air was full of exhilarating balm, and the wild oats
sprang up in the night, it seemed, and nodded their
lucent green heads on slender stems. And the wild
poppies in gorgeous colors, though great patches were
of an intense yellow like a field of the cloth of gold.</p>

<p>Sometimes Jason Chadsey of a Sunday, the only
leisure time he could find to devote to her, took his
little girl out oceanward. There were the seals
disporting themselves, there were flocks of ducks and
grebes, gulls innumerable, and everything that could
float or fly. Ships afar off, with masts and sails
visible as if indeed they were being submerged. What
stores they brought from the Orient! Spices and
silks, and all manner of queer things. And the others
coming up from the Pacific Coast, where there were
old towns dotted all along.</p>

<p>Or they took the bayside with its circle of hills, its
far-off mountains, its dots of cities yet to be. Angel
Island and Yerba Buena where the first settlement was
made, growing so slowly that in ten years not more
than twenty or thirty houses lined the beach. Or they
boarded the various small steamers, plying across or up
and down the bay. Miss Holmes did object somewhat
to this form of Sunday entertainment. There
was always a motley assemblage, and often rough language.
Men who had come from decent homes and
proper training seemed to lay it aside in the rush and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
excitement. Yet that there were many fine, earnest,
strong men among those early emigrants was most
true; men who saw the grand possibilities of this
western coast as no eastern stay-at-home could.</p>

<p>Was the old legend true that some mighty cataclysm
had rent the rocks apart and the rivers that had flowed
into the bay found an outlet to the sea? Up at the
northern end was San Pablo Bay into which emptied
the Sacramento and its tributaries, and a beautiful
fertile country spreading out in a series of brilliant
pictures, which was to be the home of thousands later
on.</p>

<p>And from here one had a fine view of the city, fast
rising into prominence on its many hills as it lay basking
in the brilliant sunshine. Irregular and full of
small green glens which now had burst into luxuriant
herbage and were glowing with gayest bloom, and
diversified with low shrubbery; then from the middle
down great belts of timber at intervals, but that portion
of the city best known now was from Yerba
Buena Cove, from North Beach to Mission Cove. Already
it was thriving, and buildings sprang up every
day as if by magic, and the busy people breathed
an enchanted air that incited them to purposes that
would have been called wildest dreams at the sober
East.</p>

<p>The little girl looked out on the changeful picture
and held tight to her uncle's hand as the throngs from
all parts of the world, and in strange attire, passed
and repassed her, giving now and then a sharp glance
which brought the bright color to her face. For the
Spanish families kept their little girls under close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
supervision, as they went decorously to and from
church on Sunday; the dirty, forlorn Indian and half-breed
children hardly attracted a moment's notice, except
to be kicked or cuffed out of the way. More
than one man glanced at Jason Chadsey with envious
eyes, and remembered a little girl at home for whom
he was striving to make a fortune.</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey did not enjoy the crowd, though the
sails to and fro had been so delightful. Miss Holmes
was shocked at the enormity of Sabbath-breaking.</p>

<p>"There is no other day," he said, in apology. "I
shouldn't like you to go alone on a week-day, the rabble
would be quite as bad."</p>

<p>She sighed, thinking of orderly Boston and its
church-going people. Not but what churches flourished
here, new as the place was, and the ready giving
of the people was a great surprise to one who had
been interested, even taken part in providing money
for various religious wants. It was a great mystery to
her that there should be so many sides to human nature.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you would like a pony?" he asked of
the little girl, as they were picking their way up the
irregularities of the pavement or where there was no
pavement at all.</p>

<p>"A pony?" There was a dubious expression in the
child's face, and a rather amazed look in her eyes.
"But&mdash;I don't know how to ride," hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"You could learn," and he smiled.</p>

<p>"But a horse is so large, and looks at you so&mdash;so
curiously&mdash;I think I do feel a little bit afraid," she admitted,
with a flush.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I mean just a nice little pony that you could
hug if you wanted to. And I guess I could teach you
to ride. Then we could have nice long journeys about.
There are so many beautiful places and such fields and
fields of wild flowers. You cannot walk everywhere.
And I have not money enough to buy a boat of my
own," with a humorous smile.</p>

<p>"I suppose a boat does cost a good deal," she returned
thoughtfully. "I love to be on the water.
Though at first I was afraid, and when that dreadful
storm came. A ship is a queer thing, isn't it? One
would think with all the people and all the cargo it
must sink. I don't see <i>how</i> it keeps up," and her face
settled into lines of perplexity, even her sweet mouth
betraying it.</p>

<p>"That is in the building. You couldn't understand
now."</p>

<p>"Do you know who made the first ship?"</p>

<p>He laughed then. He had such a hearty, jolly
laugh, though he had been tossed about the world so
much.</p>

<p>She had a mind to be a little offended. "It isn't
in the geography," she said, with dignity. "And
Columbus knew all about ships.</p>

<p>"Yes, we can go back of Columbus. The first one
I ever really heard about was Noah's Ark."</p>

<p>"Oh, Noah's Ark! I never thought of that!"
She laughed then, and the lines went out of her face.
"I'm glad we didn't have a deluge on our long journey.
And think of all the animals on board! Was
the whole world drowned out?"</p>

<p>"I believe that has never been satisfactorily settled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
And long before the time of Christ there were maritime
nations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maritime?" she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Sailors, vessels, traders. The old Ph&oelig;nicians and
the nations bordering on the Mediterranean Sea.
Though they went outside the pillars of Hercules, and
there were seamen on the Asian side of the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, how much there is for me to learn," and
she drew a long breath. "And they thought I was
real smart in our little old school. But I could spell
almost everything."</p>

<p>"There are years in which you can learn it," he said
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"And you have been almost everywhere." There
was a note of admiration in her voice. "The stories
were so wonderful when you told them on shipboard.
I didn't half understand them then because I didn't
think the world could be such a great place, so you
must tell them over to me."</p>

<p>"Yes. And some day you may go the rest of the
way round the world. You've been nearly half round
it and you are still in America."</p>

<p>They paused at the little cottage. Bruno, the great
dog, lay on the doorstep, but he rose and shook himself,
and put his nose in the little girl's hand.</p>

<p>She had been rather afraid of him at first. Even
now when he gave a low growl at some tramp prowling
round it sent a shiver down her spine. But he was
a very peaceable fellow and now devoted to his new
mistress.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes prepared the supper. She had a fondness
for housekeeping, and this life seemed idyllic to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
her. The old weariness of heart and brain had vanished.
Miss Gaines told her she looked five years
younger and that it would not take her long to go back
to twenty. Miss Gaines had made some charming
new friends and did not always spend Sunday with
them.</p>

<p>Laverne wiped the dishes for Miss Holmes. Jason
Chadsey lighted his pipe, and strolled uptown.</p>

<p>"I wish you would read all about Noah's ark to
me," Laverne said, and Miss Holmes sat down by the
lamp.</p>

<p>The child had many new thoughts about it at this
time.</p>

<p>"People must have been very wicked then if there
were not ten good ones. There are more than that
now," confidently.</p>

<p>"But the world will never be drowned again. We
have that promise."</p>

<p>"Only it is to be burned up. And that will be
dreadful, too. Do you suppose&mdash;the people will be&mdash;burned?"
hesitating awesomely.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! Don't think of that, child."</p>

<p>"I wonder why they saved so many horrid animals?
Did you ever see a tiger and a lion?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, at a menagerie."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>She had an insatiable desire for stories, this little
girl, and picked up much knowledge that way. Miss
Holmes taught her, for there was no nearby school.</p>

<p>She made friends with the Estenega girls, though
at first their mother, with true Spanish reticence and
pride held aloof, but interest in her children's welfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and a half fear of the Americanos, beside the frankness
of the little girl induced her to walk in their direction
one day, and in a shaded nook she found Miss Holmes
and her charge. Perhaps the truth was that Señora
Estenega had many lonely hours. Friends and relatives
were dead or had gone away, for there had been
no little friction when California was added to the
grasping "States." When she could sell her old
homestead she meant to remove to Monterey, which
at this period was not quite so overrun with Americanos.
But she had been born here, and her happy
childhood was connected with so many favorite haunts.
Here she had been wedded, her children born, in the
closed room where there was a little altar her husband
had died, and she kept commemorative services
on anniversaries. And then no one had offered to buy
the place&mdash;it was out of the business part, and though
the town might stretch down there, it had shown no
symptoms as yet.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes was reading and Laverne sewing.
She had taken a decided fancy to this feminine branch
of learning, and was hemming ruffles for a white
apron. Her mother had taught her long ago, when it
had been a very tiresome process. But the Estenega
girls made lace and embroidered.</p>

<p>Laverne sprang up. "It is Carmen's mother," she
said. Then she glanced up at the visitor, with her lace
mantilla thrown over her high comb, her black hair in
precise little curls, each side of her face, and her eyes
rather severe but not really unpleasant.</p>

<p>"I do not know how you say it," and she flushed
with embarrassment. "It is not Madame or Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Señora," answered the Spanish woman, her face
softening under the appealing eyes of the child.</p>

<p>Then Laverne performed the introduction with an
ease hardly expected in a child. Miss Holmes rose.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to meet you. I was deciding to
come to ask about the children. Laverne is often
lonely and would like playmates. And she is picking
up many Spanish words. You understand English."</p>

<p>"Somewhat. It is of necessity. These new people
have possessed our country and you cannot always
trust servants to interpret. Yes, the children. I have
a little fear. They are Catholics. Carmencita will go
to the convent next year for her education. And I
should not want their faith tampered with."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Miss Holmes responded cheerfully.
"You know we have different kinds of faith and yet
agree as friends." And glancing at Laverne she almost
smiled. These Spanish children would be much
more likely to convert her to their faith. Would her
uncle mind, she wondered? He seemed to think they
all stood on the same foundation.</p>

<p>"You have not been here long?" and there was
more assertion than inquiry in the tone.</p>

<p>"No," returned the younger woman. And then she
told a part of her story, how she had come from the
east, the Atlantic coast, and that she was governess
to the child, and housekeeper. "Did the Señora know
a family by the name of Vanegas?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, they were old friends. Two daughters,
admirable girls, devoted to their mother, who had suffered
much and whose husband had made away with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
most of the estates. There was an American lady in
her house, she rented two rooms."</p>

<p>"A friend of mine. She came from the same place,
and we have known each other from girlhood."</p>

<p>Then the ice was broken, and Miss Holmes in a certain
manner was vouched for, which rather amused
her, yet she accepted the Spanish woman's pride.
Many of them felt as if they had been banished from
their own land by these usurpers. Others accepted
the new order of things, and joined heart and soul in
the advancement of the place, the advancement of their
own fortunes also. But these were mostly men. The
prejudice of the women died harder.</p>

<p>The children were in a group at one of the little
hillocks, much amused it would seem by their laughter.
And the two women patched up a bit of friendship
which they both needed, seeing they were near neighbors,
and interested in the education of young people,
Miss Holmes listened to what the elder woman said
and did not contradict or call the ideas old-fashioned.
After all it was very like some of her old grandmother's
strictures, and she was a staunch Puritan.
What would she have said to women who had not yet
reached middle life, and had planned to go to a strange
land to seek their fortunes!</p>

<p>The Señora was so well satisfied that she asked Miss
Holmes to come and take coffee and sweetmeats with
her the next afternoon.</p>

<p>Oh, how lovely the hills and vales were as they wandered
homeward. For now it was the time of growth
and bloom and such sweetness in the air that Marian
Holmes thought of the gales of Araby the blest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Truly it was an enchanted land. The birds were filling
the air with melody, here and there a farmer or
gardener, for there was fine cultivated lands about the
foothills, and even higher up there were great patches
of green where some one would reap a harvest, garden
stuff waving or running about rich with melon blooms,
here the blue of the wild forget-me-nots and the
lupines. And further on flocks of sheep nibbling the
tufts of grass or alfalfa. Some one was singing a
song, a rich, young voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me,</p>
<p>I'm goin' to California with my banjo on my knee."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here and there in a clump of trees was a dark shadow,
and the long slant rays betokened the coming of evening.
It gave one a luxurious emotion, as if here was
the true flavor of life.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes was feeling a little sorry for those
swept off of their own land, as it were.</p>

<p>"What have they been doing with it these hundreds
of years?" asked Jason Chadsey. "Even the Indians
they have pretended to educate are little better off for
their civilization. And think how the gold lay untouched
in the hills! Spain still has the Philippines
with all her treasures."</p>

<p>It rained the next morning with a musical patter on
everything, and little rivulets ran down the steps.
Then it suddenly lighted up and all San Francisco was
glorified. Pablo, an old Mexican, came to work in the
little garden patch. Laverne said her lessons, then
went out to find her squirrels and talk to her birds who
came to enjoy the repast of crumbs, and then went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
hunting bugs and worms for their importunate babies.
And at last they were making ready for their walk.</p>

<p>"It is nice to go out visiting," Laverne said, as she
danced along, for the sunshine and the magnetic air
had gotten into the child's feet. "We have been nowhere
but at Mrs. Dawson's."</p>

<p>"And Miss Gaines."</p>

<p>"Oh, that isn't really visiting. Just a little cake
and fruit on a plate. And now she is so busy she can
hardly look at you. I wish we lived farther up in the
town. Don't you think Uncle Jason would move if
you said you did not like it here?"</p>

<p>"But I do like it. And there are so many dreadful
things happening all about the town. And we might
be burned out."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad of the Estenegas, anyhow."</p>

<p>The old place was like some of the other old homes
going to decay now, but it was so embowered with
vines that one hardly noted it. The chimney had
partly fallen in, the end of the porch roof was propped
up by a pile of stones. But the great veranda was a
room in itself, with its adobe floor washed clean, and the
big jars of bloom disposed around, the wicker chairs,
the piles of cushions, and the low seats for the children.
Little tables stood about with work, many of the women
were very industrious, the mothers thinking of possible
trousseaus, when laces and fine drawn work would be
needed. Carmencita had her cushion on her knees,
and her slim fingers carried the thread over the pins in
and out, in a fashion that mystified Laverne.</p>

<p>"It's like the labyrinth," she said.</p>

<p>"What was that?" glancing up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, a place that was full of all kinds of queer
passages and you did not know how to get out unless
you took a bit of thread and wound it up when you
came back."</p>

<p>"But I know where I am going. Now, this is round
the edge of a leaf. I leave that little place for a loop,
and then I come back so. The Señorita Felicia makes
beautiful lace for customers. But mine will be for myself
when I am married."</p>

<p>"But I thought&mdash;you were going to a convent," said
Laverne, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"So I am. But that will be for education, accomplishments.
And there are more Spanish men there,"
lowering her voice, "more lovers. Pepito Martinez,
who lived in the other end of the old place, down
there," nodding her head southward, "found a splendid
lover and was married in the chapel. Her mother
went on to live with her. They had no troublesome
house to sell," and she sighed.</p>

<p>"Juana," exclaimed the mother, "get thy guitar.
The guests may like some music."</p>

<p>Juana rose obediently. She, too, was older than Laverne,
but Anesta younger. She seated herself on
one of the low stools, and passed a broad scarlet
ribbon about her neck, which made her look very picturesque.
And she played well, indeed, for such a
child. Then she sang several little songs in a soft, extremely
youthful voice. Miss Holmes was much interested.</p>

<p>The children were sent to play. There was a little
pond with several tame herons, there were two great
cages of mocking birds that sang and whistled to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
discomfiture of the brilliant green and scarlet parrot.
The children ran races in the walk bordered with wild
olive trees on the one side, and on the other a great
tangle of flowers, with the most beautiful roses Laverne
had ever seen, and hundreds of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I should like to live here," declared Laverne.</p>

<p>"Then ask thy uncle to buy. The Americanos have
money in plenty. And see here. It is my tame stork.
His leg was broken so he could not fly. Diego bound
it up and he staid here. But when he sees a gun he
dashes away and hides."</p>

<p>He had a number of amusing tricks, but he eyed the
strange little girl suspiciously and would not let her
come too near.</p>

<p>They went back to the house and swung in the hammock,
talking broken English and Spanish and laughing
merrily over the blunders. Carmencita put away
her lace and began to prepare two of the small tables,
spreading over each a beautiful cloth.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes had been taken through the apartments.
There were three on the lower floor, the
kitchen being detached. The walls were a dark faded
red, the windows small, with odd little panes of glass.
There was some fine old furniture, and a rug soft as
velvet on the floor that long ago had crossed the ocean.
Family portraits were hung high on the wall, and
looked down frowningly, the brilliancy of their garments
faded and tarnished, but Miss Holmes noted that
they were mostly all military men. In the next room
were several portraits of the priests of the family, and
hideous copies of the old Madonnas. In this room a
high cabinet of wonderful carving, filled with curios
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
and one shelf of books. The third was evidently a
sitting and sleeping chamber, with a spindle-post bedstead
and canopy of faded yellow silk, edged with old
lace; while the bedspread in its marvellous handiwork
would have filled a connoisseur with envy. For
two hundred years or more there had been Estenegas
here, and then the old part, now fallen down, had its
ballroom and its long dining room where banquets
and wedding feasts had been given.</p>

<p>"There is another branch of the family at Santa
Margarita who have not fallen into decay as we have,
and as many old families do. I dare say they would be
glad to have some of the heirlooms. They have young
men, and it would be but right that they should propose
to marry one of my daughters."</p>

<p>Carmen summoned her mother and the guest. The
tables were daintily arranged with fruit and custards,
some sweet fried cakes and bread covered with a
sort of jelly compound that was very appetizing, with
some shredded cold chicken highly spiced. For drink,
tea for the elders, but fruit juice made of orange and
berries for the young people. Carmencita was at the
table with her mother, the three others together, and
they had a merry time.</p>

<p>The Señora and the children walked part of the way
with them. Miss Holmes had proposed that they
should come up in the morning for lessons with Laverne.
The distance to the Sisters' school was too great,
and now one dreaded to send young girls through the
new part of the town.</p>

<p>"It was very nice," declared Laverne, "only I think
I like the little Maine girls better. They understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
more quickly, and they have so many thoughts about
everything, while you have to explain continually as
you talk to these children."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is because they do not understand the
language," said Miss Holmes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
PELAJO</h2>

<p>Laverne was about to reply, with the feeling of superior
knowledge, "It's because they are not Americans,"
when she caught sight of Uncle Jason, Pablo,
and a pile of rough timber, an excavation made in the
side hill, a slope over which she had been training some
blossoming vines.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Jason," she cried, with eager forbiddance.
"That's my garden. What are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"Build a house for a pony. This seemed most
convenient, though he is such a cunning little fellow I
think we could have trained him to go up the steps."</p>

<p>His shrewd, humorous smile and her own curiosity
disarmed her.</p>

<p>"The pony? Have you really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I had to take him or see him go to some one
else. I was afraid he would get a hard master. And
he is such a pretty intelligent fellow. He talks, his
fashion. And he laughs, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, now you are making fun."</p>

<p>"Well, if you won't have him I can sell him again.
He's just fit for a little girl, or some one hardly grown
up."</p>

<p>"But who had him before?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"A young lady. A delicate little body. I've had
my eye on him some time."</p>

<p>"If she loved him why did she want to sell him?"
and Laverne glanced up with a kind of incredulity.</p>

<p>"She was going away." He had not the courage
to say that she was dead, that she had made a vain
struggle for recovery, and failed.</p>

<p>"I suppose horses are not quite like people," she
returned thoughtfully. "They like those who are good
to them."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;they're grateful, and as a general thing appreciate
kind treatment. Humans don't always do
that."</p>

<p>She had not gone very far in the philosophy of ingratitude,
but she was wondering if the pony had been
very fond of his mistress.</p>

<p>"This place was the handiest. Then he can go cropping
the tufts of grass about here, and we shall not have
to lug the feed up on the next round," viewing the sort
of natural terraces with a squint in one eye. "I'm
sorry about the posies."</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;they grow so easily. And here was the
spruce tree, and, oh, we ought to have a big veranda
to the house, where we could sit and sew and I could
study lessons and we could have supper."</p>

<p>"But the place isn't really mine, you know. And
I shouldn't want to spend a great deal of money.
Some day we may have a house in which we can truly
settle ourselves."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes, who had been looking on, smiled now.
"The Señora Estenega is very anxious to sell," she
said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"And it is so splendid all around. There are trees
and trees and they are full of birds. Oh, you never
heard such singing. And the flowers! Why, I wanted
to dance all around the paths for very gladness. But
it was dull and dark inside, and full of ugly portraits
and Virgins and hideous babies."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't want to sell the pictures, they are
old family relics," appended Miss Holmes.</p>

<p>"And she asks a fortune for the estate. These old
Spanish people have caught on to values mighty quick.
But a house for the pony is as much as we can compass
now. In a few years you shall have a home to
your liking."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes went within, and soon there was a
savory smell of fish frying and cakes baking on a bed
of coals.</p>

<p>"That will do for to-night, Pablo," Jason Chadsey
said. "Come early to-morrow morning and I will
show you about the posts."</p>

<p>The Mexican nodded slowly, and walked to the
kitchen door, where Miss Holmes gave him a chunk
of bread and a fish, and he went his way.</p>

<p>Uncle Jason washed hands and face in true Yankee
fashion, with a great splurge. He had enlarged the
rude cistern and led a rivulet of clear water down to
it. In many of the outlying districts there were but
few conveniences, and yet San Francisco had flashed
into existence as if a new Kubla Khan had decreed it.
Perhaps no city in the world could boast such rapid advances,
or gain in population. Those early years will
always sound like a fairy tale. But it had some of the
best and most energetic brain and brawn from the East,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
whose forefathers had settled other wildernesses much
less promising.</p>

<p>The pony shared interest with the visit and the
promise of the Estenega girls coming up every morning.
She was a very happy little girl to-night; Uncle
Jason thought she had not been quite so bright of late,
but now her eyes flashed with an eager light, and her
pretty lips melted from one curve to another, while her
voice had a bird-like gayety. The day had been so
full and taken so much energy, that she laid her head
in Miss Holmes' lap and went fast asleep. Jason
Chadsey read his paper by the light of the smoky lamp,
and Miss Holmes dreamed of clean, orderly Boston
even if its streets did run crooked.</p>

<p>The Estenegas were certainly not bright scholars.
But the Yankee schoolma'am had seen obtuse children
before. They were extremely narrow and incurious
as to real knowledge, but anxious to get on with English.
Laverne flashed up and down the walk. Pablo
set up the frame, put on a rude roof, then filled in the
chinks with a common kind of adobe. The pony would
not live much indoors, to be sure, but he needed some
shelter.</p>

<p>"Do you know what his name is, Pablo?" the child
asked.</p>

<p>Pablo shook his head. He was a dried-up specimen,
with a skin like leather and small deep-set eyes, quite
bowed in the shoulders, which made him no taller than
some boys of a dozen years. He had a little hut of
his own down in the wilds, and he often lay on the
sand when the sun was too hot, and drowsed from
pure laziness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Jason led the pony home at night. He had
been well kept, for his coat was smooth, just far enough
off of black to be a rich brown. Shapely, with slender
legs, a head not too large for his body, a flowing mane,
now braided up in tails, flexible nostrils that quivered
with every breath, and the most beautiful large, dark
eyes that looked as if they could laugh and understand
many things.</p>

<p>She had been somewhat dubious all along. She had
really felt afraid of Bruno at first, but as she looked at
the merry eyes she laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>do</i> like you," she said. "I'm glad you are
not any larger. And his tail almost sweeps the
ground," watching her uncle, who was patting his neck
and smoothing down to his nose, and talking in a persuasive
voice.</p>

<p>"Maybe you won't like his name. He comes of
good stock, it seems, and if he was ten years younger
would be worth a pile of money."</p>

<p>"Why, he doesn't look old. And his name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is Pelajo."</p>

<p>She repeated it, and he came a step nearer. She
ventured to pat him, and then she reached up and put
her arm over his neck. Uncle Jason handed her a
lump of sugar, but she drew back as his soft nose
touched her hand.</p>

<p>"You must learn to give him tidbits, even a handful
of grass or wild oats."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall like you very much, I know," she declared,
in a glad voice, and he seemed to understand,
for he rubbed against her shoulder, and this time she
did not shrink away. He was used to being caressed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Perhaps he dumbly questioned what had become of his
sweet young mistress who had petted him the last year.</p>

<p>It was so warm they tethered him and set Bruno to
keep watch, for there were many prowlers and thieves
about; not quite as many down here perhaps, since
horses and money were the only desirable things in
their estimation. He was all right in the morning.
The first thing Laverne did was to rush out and greet
him, and he seemed quite as glad to see her.</p>

<p>She did shake a little when she was perched up on
his back, but Uncle Jason walked beside her up and
down the gravelly path, and after a little it was really
exhilarating. When she had taken two or three lessons
she felt quite safe and began to enjoy it. Uncle
Jason taught her to ride astride as well; it might be
useful, he declared, and certainly was a common-sense
view of the matter. So Pelajo grew into the little girl's
heart.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning she always went to church with
Miss Holmes, and the churches were really well filled
if the rest of the day was devoted to pleasure. The
lovely spring was now over, though fruit trees were
still blooming and laden with fruit. But there had
been a few days that seemed to scorch up everything
and dry up the small streams and cisterns.</p>

<p>The church bells were ringing in a leisurely, devoted
fashion. "Come to church for rest and refreshment,"
they said, when suddenly there was a wild clangor and
each one looked at his neighbor with frightened eyes,
or stood motionless, not knowing which way to turn.
Then something shot up in the air, scarlet against the
sunshine, and the cry of terror rang out, "Fire! Fire!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>There had been a fear lest the gang of lawless
desperadoes who had half threatened and half laughed
about keeping the anniversary of the great fire the
year before would make some endeavor. But June 14th
had passed, though there had been unusual watchfulness.
After a week the orderly part of the city
breathed more freely. And this day seemed almost
like a special thanksgiving for safety. Before they
had time to voice it the red terror began. Crowds with
hymn and prayer books in their hands paused paralyzed
before the church they had made such efforts to gain
and enjoyed so thoroughly, the brief five months they
had worshipped in it. And now they fled up and down
the streets, while the fire swept this way and that with
a tremendous roar. From Pacific over to Jackson
Street, Washington, Stockton, Dupont. Goods and invalids
were hurried out to the Plaza, and then the wind
swept the fire this way and that, and they had to fly
again and save nothing. Buildings were blown up
with a horrid din like war. And so for four mortal
hours of frantic endeavor with no reservoirs near. And
when it had ceased to spread it lay a great mass of
charred and smouldering ruins, and several lives had
gone with it. That it was the work of incendiaries
there could be no doubt. Ruined men invoked the arm
of speedy justice if they could not have law.</p>

<p>In one way it was not so disastrous as the fire of the
year before, which had taken the business part and immense
stocks of goods. This was more of a residential
section, but homeless people were running to and fro,
wild with the agony of loss of all they had. Parents
and children separated, elderly people wandering about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
in a dazed condition, the scene one of the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes had decided to go over to hear Mr.
Williams, instead of the church nearer by, which she
usually attended. Then they would go to Mr. Dawson's
for lunch, and meet Miss Gaines and bring her
home with them. At first she thought she could find
a way through, but the fire spread so rapidly over to
Montgomery Street, that she did not dare venture. It
might go down to the very edge of the bay and on its
march take in the Dawsons. She held tight to Laverne,
and used strenuous efforts to force her way through,
but throngs were coming up, drawn by a weird fascination
such as a fire always exercises. The child began
to cry. Her hat was torn off. Oh, if anything <i>should</i>
happen to her!</p>

<p>After a while the way began to grow clearer, but it
seemed as if she was in a new place.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so tired," cried Laverne. "And my foot
hurts. Let us sit down."</p>

<p>They were out of the well-built part. A tall old
pine offered shelter. She sat down on the dry earth
and took the child in her lap.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think Uncle Jason will be burned up?"
she moaned. "If we could only find him. And will
our house go, too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear. It is in a different direction. That
will be safe."</p>

<p>"If we could only get there. Do you think Pelajo
will be frightened? And everything looks so strange
here. Are you not afraid of all these wild men?"</p>

<p>They seemed, indeed, inhabitants of every clime.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
And though they looked sharply at the woman and
child, no one molested them.</p>

<p>"Are you rested now? Shall we go home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do hope Uncle Jason is there. What if he
had come to the fire and was killed!"</p>

<p>"Hush, dear! Don't think of such a thing."</p>

<p>What would she do alone with the child if any untoward
accident happened to him? She shuddered!</p>

<p>They picked their way over strange places, but they
still saw the black smoke of the holocaust going skyward.
Miss Holmes kept one or two objective points
in mind. True, streets had been laid out, but they were
overgrown with brush and the rampant cactus, with
tangles of vines. In some places they had begun to
wither. Rabbits scurried hither and thither, amazed at
the steps. Birds were still carolling as if there was
naught but joy in the world.</p>

<p>"And I am so hungry! Oh, when will we get
home? Suppose we are lost?" complained the child
wearily.</p>

<p>"I think we have been lost, but now I see where we
are," the elder exclaimed, in a hopeful tone. "It is
not far. And then we will have a nice supper. Poor,
tired little girl, I wish I could carry you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't," and there was a sound in her
voice as if she had smiled. "But if it isn't much farther&mdash;my
legs feel as if they would drop off."</p>

<p>"We have come ever so much out of our way. I
could not see in the crowd, and it pushed one about so.
I never want to see another fire."</p>

<p>"Oh, now I know." Laverne let go of the elder's
hand, and in spite of fatigue gave two or three skips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
"Could I make Bruno hear, I wonder? Bruno!
Bru&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>Either she made him hear or he had a presentiment.
He came bounding through the brush with short, sharp
barks of joy, and lunged so against Laverne that she
nearly lost her balance.</p>

<p>"Oh, good doggie, good Bruno!" she cried, in joy.
"What if there were dogs burned up in the fire, and
maybe horses?"</p>

<p>Miss Holmes shuddered. She had seen some men
carrying a mattress with a human body, when a fierce
blazing brand had fallen in it, and though she turned
her head then, she almost screamed now.</p>

<p>They dropped down on the small porch steps and sat
there a few moments.</p>

<p>"I must go and see Pelajo," Laverne said, weary as
she was.</p>

<p>He whinnied with joy, and rubbed his nose on her
small hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pelajo, I am so glad you were not in the fire,"
and she could have kissed him for very thankfulness.</p>

<p>Uncle Jason was nowhere to be seen. When Miss
Holmes was a little rested she built a fire and put on
the kettle. There was part of the leg of lamb they had
had yesterday, and the pie she had baked early this
morning. For in spite of all his wanderings, Jason
Chadsey had preserved his New England fondness for
such pies as a New England woman could make. And
there was a great bowl of delicious berries.</p>

<p>They had their meal, being puzzled just what to call
it, since it was a little too early for supper. Then they
swung in the hammocks while old Pablo came to look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
after Pelajo, and talk about the fire, which he insisted
was still burning. They waited and waited until the
poor little girl begged to go to bed.</p>

<p>"It hasn't seemed a bit like Sunday," she murmured
sleepily.</p>

<p>Then Marian Holmes swung drowsily in the hammock
again. Through the opening between two trees
she could see the great glowing stars that seemed as
gorgeous again as in the eastern skies. There were
screams of night birds, the long note of the owl, the
tree frog beseeching stridently for rain. Now and then
Bruno would flip his ears or straighten them, and at
last he gave a sudden rush down the street, and returned
with his master, but the clock had struck
ten.</p>

<p>He dropped on the step as they had done.</p>

<p>"Were you alarmed when you came from church?
Of course you knew about the fire."</p>

<p>"We were really in it," and Miss Holmes detailed
her day, leaving out some of the most trying incidents.</p>

<p>"Thank God you came back safely," he returned,
with deep feeling. "It was a most awful catastrophe.
There has been an indignation meeting held, and some
of the miscreants will be brought to justice. Then,
there must be better arrangements for fighting fires.
It was a terrific sight, and there are hundreds of homeless
people. The best provision that could be, was
made for them. Generous-hearted people took them
in, supplied them with food. Accidents were plentiful.
Yet it has been a terrible day, but if I had thought of
you and the child being there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't, you see. And we came safely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
out of it all, so don't feel distressed. Will you have
some supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Though I was at the Dawsons' and had a
meal. They came mighty near going once or twice,
if a dangerous gust of wind had lasted longer. And
the crowds that poured in upon them! The courage
of these people seems superhuman, but it has been
severely tried now. I do not believe any city ever
suffered so much by fire and had the pluck to go on
again."</p>

<p>She began to busy herself about the meal. He
leaned against the flat post and went sound asleep,
though he wakened easily. Then leaving her dishes,
an unusual thing for her, she retired herself.</p>

<p>For days the fire was the uppermost subject. They
had always planned rebuilding before with tremendous
energy, but now courage seemed to wane in this direction.
But it was taken up energetically in others.
The great want of water in the fire department had
to be remedied speedily, and at any cost. Money was
offered freely.</p>

<p>The other was a more strenuous effort for the punishment
of criminals, and a rigorous observance of
law.</p>

<p>Among the immigrants had been convicts from different
lands, lawless men who formed themselves into
bands for plunder and maliciousness. Clark's Point,
Broadway, and one end of Pacific Street was called
Sydney Town from its great number of convicts and
ticket-of-leave men from the Colonies; and to them
were added the criminally inclined from the States,
who had left their own cities for the city's good. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
out of the earnest endeavor to put a stop to the lawlessness
and crime the Vigilance Committee was
formed. Then an old Mexican law was exhumed that
forbade the emigration to California of criminals
convicted of crime elsewhere. Notices were served
upon many vicious persons and they were compelled
to leave the city. And with it all grew a greater
regard for law and order.</p>

<p>Energy and perseverance did not fail, it is true, and
the confidence born of the geographical knowledge that
this must eventually be the great highway of trade, and
the idea of a glorious future destiny, inspired the really
solid portion of the community to continue their efforts
to make it the city of the world. Still, many of the
middle classes, discouraged by misfortunes, returned to
their native cities. Others went further south in the
more equable climate and became farmers. Still others
wooed by the endless forests further north, and the
many advantages for starting new cities on a better
industrial foundation, went to seek better fortunes.
The city never could recover from all the evils it was
said. But the splendid bay and the magnificent harbor
were left, the gold fields were not exhausted. And
now arose the demand for a railroad across the Continent,
which had a hard fight for many years, but
succeeded at length.</p>

<p>At Clark's Point a huge rock was quarried, and removed,
and the hill excavated to make room for new
streets. Sansome and Battery Streets were carried out
and filled up with the débris. The wharves were
pushed further out, great warehouses built, and though
it was a fact that fewer people came to seek their fortunes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
more brought with them the idea of settling.
Wherever any tiny stream ran among the sand hills
numerous vegetable gardens were laid out, and the fertility
was remarkable. Markets opened here and there,
the New World Market, enlarged and improved, where
it seemed as if one might buy all the luxuries of the
world. San Francisco began to lose the characteristics
of a Spanish or Mexican town, how could such drowsy
ways be tolerated among the adventurous, hard-working
people!</p>

<p>There came to be an admixture of foreign races&mdash;musical
Germans; light-hearted, theatre and dance-loving
French; some from different Mongolian countries,
who looked on with grave faces, seldom affiliating,
and the Chinese, who made a settlement of their
own, many of them content to be hewers of wood and
drawers of water, laundrymen and servants, but others
aspiring to the rank of merchants, even bringing their
wives later on.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the bay, settlements were
changing into towns, and business seemed to run riot
everywhere. There was no lack of employment for
those willing to work.</p>

<p>All these things were far away from the little girl's
life. She studied because she loved to know about
everything, that was a New England heritage. She
acquired Spanish rapidly, while the Estenega girls
were stumbling over English. The Señora came up
one afternoon and they had a sort of high tea, with
game of several kinds, a bird pie, and a pudding that
would have rejoiced the heart of a far Easterner. It
was a wonderful feast for the children, but the Señora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
shook her head gravely over the superabundance of
luxuries.</p>

<p>"Was not the little girl going to learn lace-making
and drawn-work that she would want presently for her
trousseau? And were not the catechism and the prayers,
confirmation, music, and languages enough for any
girl? And these new Americanos, who dressed in
silks and velvets, and trailed up and down the streets
nodding and laughing to men!" and the Señora
shuddered.</p>

<p>It was very true that stylishly attired women promenaded
the two shopping streets where the windows
were full of rich goods. For the early settlers had
not to spin and weave in this golden country. Vessels
were coming in frequently laden with goods from almost
everywhere. India and China sent treasures,
France and England did not lag behind. So the women
went gorgeously arrayed, leaned out of handsome private
equipages, as if they were queens. For gold was
found in most unexpected places, and miners came in
only to waste and gamble it away.</p>

<p>The old Spanish residents shook their heads over
this wild extravagance, and clung more closely to their
Church and the old ways. Even the natives were often
amazed. There were not a few who had Spanish
blood, and proud enough they were of it. The emigration
of the French began to exercise an influence upon
the heterogeneous society. The skilled workman gave
a finer air to shops and buildings; the higher classes,
lured by the wonderful reports, added their ease and
refinement to the society, gradually crystallizing into
settled classes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not all the Americans," Miss Holmes said, in
answer to the Señora's strictures. "All the Eastern
cities I have seen are quite unlike this. They grew
slowly, and each from its own peculiar industry. We
had no gold mines on the Eastern coast, and you are
likely to prize more highly the fortunes you have to
struggle for. Here we have every nation, it seems to
me, and often the very liberty of choice degenerates
into license. But it is hardly fair to blame it all on
our people."</p>

<p>"They have invaded us and taken away our land,
our rights. Years ago we were happy and content,
and now it is all excitement, and if you do not join
you are pushed to the wall, driven out. The gold in
the hills was all ours."</p>

<p>"But you let it lie there. Yes, you could have discovered
it. It was the wild dream of more than one
explorer, and yet he never tapped the great secrets the
land held."</p>

<p>Now that the hitherto placid Spanish woman was
roused she went over the ground with great bitterness,
the war, the ceding of the country, the influx of the
nations for greed. Half her talk lapsed into her native
tongue. Miss Holmes pitied her in a certain way, but
was it not the old, old story since De Soto had crossed
the Continent and Tonti came down the Mississippi?
The weaker nation was always distanced by the
stronger. And was supine content a virtue?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the children had a merry time. Carmen
gained courage to mount Pelajo and rode around in
fine style. The younger ones wanted their turn.
When they were called in to tea their cheeks glowed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
their eyes were bright with excitement, and they
chattered like a flock of birds.</p>

<p>The Señora looked on in surprise.</p>

<p>"Do you always allow so much wildness?" she
asked, in a rather disapproving tone.</p>

<p>If they had a little frolic their walk home always
sobered them.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," returned Miss Holmes, with a smile.
"They have lessons. This is a holiday. And I am
glad for Laverne to have companions. We sometimes
think she gets too grave."</p>

<p>"Girls," and their mother rapped on the table.
What with their laughing, the broken English, and the
Spanish they were in quite a whirl. Laverne looked
on more calmly. Indeed, the Señora was a little angry
that she seemed rather to shame her girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Señora, do not scold them. We were
so merry riding the pony. He is almost human. And
he understood Spanish. I did not know that before."</p>

<p>Laverne's face was a study, in its sweet pleading.
The girls quieted down, and their mother looked less
severe, but she was considering a proper penance.</p>

<p>The moon came up early. How magnificently the
soft light silvered all the open spaces, until one forgot
the drought. Each twig that swayed to and fro in the
translucent air seemed alive.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes and Laverne walked some distance
with their guests, leaving Bruno to keep watch. They
parted with the utmost cordiality.</p>

<p>"We have had such a splendid time," whispered
Carmencita. "I wish I was an American girl and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
a good indulgent uncle such as thou hast, little one.
Then I would not care to go to the convent."</p>

<p>Laverne was astonished at the outburst, for Carmen
had heretofore rather cavilled at Americans. They
walked back in silence until they met Bruno's greeting.</p>

<p>"Didn't you have a nice time with the girls?" Miss
Holmes asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Carmen was&mdash;well, I think I have been
not exactly afraid of her, but she seemed so much older,
and this afternoon she was splendid. And she wished&mdash;what
do you think&mdash;that she was an American girl!
And I wish I knew some American girls."</p>

<p>"You will go to school presently. Your uncle was
talking of it."</p>

<p>The thought startled the little girl. She was not
quite sure she liked it.</p>

<p>"Oh, there he is now," and she ran to meet him.
The moon was up higher and it was lighter. Her
hands were outstretched, but he caught her under the
arms and, lifting her up, gave her several kisses. It
was so gratifying to have her always glad to see him.</p>

<p>Then he put her down and she caught his hand in
both of hers and went a hop and a skip, giving short,
soft laughs.</p>

<p>"I'm late. Did you eat up all the supper?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we had ours early. The Estenegas were here,
the mother and all. We had a good, good time," with
emphasis. "They all rode Pelajo. Anesta fell off
twice, but it didn't hurt any, she asked us not to tell.
And oh, how hungry they were!"</p>

<p>"Little girls ought always to be hungry. That
makes them grow."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"And Carmen wished she had an uncle like you."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;she has scarcely seen me."</p>

<p>"But then I talk about you," the child added,
naïvely.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;do you want to give me away?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no."</p>

<p>"Or shall we adopt her?"</p>

<p>A positive unwillingness sprang up in the child's
heart.</p>

<p>"I think her mother would not let her come," she
replied evasively.</p>

<p>"But you would like her? You are tired of being
alone."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want any one but you for all time,"
she admitted, a little jealously.</p>

<p>He laughed. He was fond of this confession.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes' supper was satisfactory to the hungry
man as well. Afterward they went out and sat on the
flat stone step. That always made him think of his
boyhood.</p>

<p>"Little one," he began, "how would you like to
move? Or are the Estenegas too dear to give up?"</p>

<p>"Move!" in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. We haven't much worldly goods, as these
traps do not belong to us. But we can take ourselves,
Bruno, and Pelajo."</p>

<p>"Where would we go?"</p>

<p>"Quite far from here. Up on Telegraph Hill."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be splendid! We could always
see the bay, and over the strait to all the mountains
beyond. Yes, I should like to go."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad. It will be more convenient for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
me, but we would have to go, anyhow. This place has
been sold."</p>

<p>"Is there a stable? And I think I would like a
garden. And at least <i>one</i> tree."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"They have been taking down part of the hill.
No doubt some day they will take it all down. That
is the fashion of cities. But our end not being so high
will not be disturbed for some time to come."</p>

<p>"This has been nice," she said retrospectively.
"But I shall like the new place, and the bay, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the change," he laughed. Then he called
Miss Holmes, who had put away the last of her dishes.</p>

<p>He had talked this over with her before, but he had
not made his bargain until to-day. Then they settled
a few of the most important points. There were to
be some repairs made, but they could go the next
week. And to-morrow he would take them up to see
it.</p>

<p>"Will you like to go?" Laverne asked of Miss
Holmes as they were preparing for bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I shall. We shall be so much nearer
everything. We can often walk down among the
stores. And we shall be nearer Miss Gaines. You
will miss the Estenega girls."</p>

<p>"But there may be other girls. I'd like to know
some new ones," and there was a sound of delightful
expectation in her voice.

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK</h2>

<p>It was almost being in a new town, Laverne thought.
They had trotted all over this bluff, to be sure; they
had looked over to Sausalito, up and down the bay, and
to the wonderful ocean that reached to China. But before
they had been rather hidden away in a valley
between the ridges, and from the windows you could
see very little. She was quite wild at first, running
from window to window, and calling on Miss Holmes
to see this or that.</p>

<p>Then they had a Chinaman to come in and help them
settle, and that amused her very much. He understood,
but could not speak much English, and she did
wonder why he should tack another syllable to the
short words by adding the double e. But he was very
handy and obedient, quick to see, and the soft shoes
that made no clatter allowed him to go about so quietly
that he often surprised one. His name was Ah Ling.</p>

<p>"I think I like Pablo better," she said gravely.
"Then he knows so many things about the country
and the missions and the priests, and the races of the
Spaniards, and they did have bull fights, you know,
they have some now. Uncle Jason said he must not tell
me about them, they were too cruel. Do you suppose
Pablo will come?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>Jason Chadsey had made the old Mexican an offer
to come and live with them, but he was loath to leave
his little hut and his independence. He knew Pablo
could be trusted anywhere with the little girl, and
that he was a good gardener. He had even offered
him a new hut, and Pablo was taking matters into consideration
as he lolled in the sun and smoked his pipe.
He did not want to be too hard worked, what good
did so much money do these Americanos; they went
on working and working and hustling the life out of
one.</p>

<p>Here was the old Franciscan Mission where the first
settlement was made by the Fathers. It might have
had the semi-solitude in those early years, for all
about was poetic enough. When it became a Mexican
province early in the century it had been stripped of
its treasures, and was even now a poor unsightly ruin
with its few padres eking out their subsistence and
saying prayers for the living and the dead in the little
Campo Santo. Presently a modern cathedral was to
overshadow it, but that had not come yet, with the
shops and dwellings that were to crowd it still closer.
But now there were outlying fields, tangles of shrubbery
and vines run wild. Not so many trees as farther
down, but still some that withstood the ocean blasts.
And there was Alcatras and Buena Yerba; almost
within a stone's throw, it seemed, in the clear air that
often foreshortened space. Laverne never wearied
studying the marvellous pictures, and when her
thoughts went back to the dreary little Maine village
she always gave a shiver.</p>

<p>The house was a newer one, its first story of adobe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
as so many were in the early days. It was not nearly
so small, to begin with, and there was so much entertainment
buying furniture and supplying household
needs. Jason Chadsey had picked up a number of
curious articles from the ships coming in from foreign
ports, some that would have been the envy of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>But the early spring was rushing on again and every
leaf and spear and weed grew as if by magic.</p>

<p>One morning they had a visitor who came in a carriage,
and Miss Holmes glanced out in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, it's my friend Miss Alwood&mdash;you remember
Miss Grace, Laverne. I haven't seen her this
long while," and the next instant she was welcoming
her warmly.</p>

<p>"We thought you had dropped out of existence.
Why, even the Dawsons have heard nothing from you&mdash;let
me see&mdash;you went down to Santa Cruz with an
invalid lady&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes." Miss Alwood gave a short amused sound
that was hardly a laugh, and continued: "Well, there
was plenty of money, but she was about as queer as
they make them. She had come from Baltimore, but
she had some of the worst New England features,
though I think they do not belong altogether to the
Puritan birthright. But it kept one on the alert attending
to her whims. When she had been there a
month her brother came to see her. He thought she
had better go on farther south&mdash;I think she had consumption,
the sort of wasting away without a cough.
While we were making preparations she was taken
down to her bed. Mr. Personette had to return here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
on urgent business matters. Four weeks later she
died. So he came back and there was the burial and
all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Alwood paused and a flush with an amused
expression passed over her face.</p>

<p>"And so you were released from bondage," suggested
Miss Holmes; and she, somehow, smiled, too.</p>

<p>"And accepted another. Mr. Personette, being a
widower, made me an offer of marriage. We are to be
a not very far-away neighbor, as he owns a house on
Mason Street, and is really well-to-do, as we say at
home. There is a son of seventeen, a daughter two
years younger, and one of twelve. I went to hunt you
up, but found the place deserted, then looked up Miss
Gaines and have been spending a week over wedding
gowns, though it is to be just a quiet marriage in church.
He has had housekeepers that were unsatisfactory, indeed,
he was afraid the last one would marry him out
of hand," and this time she did laugh heartily. "So
you see I have made my fortune the first of the trio."</p>

<p>"Let me congratulate you on your good fortune.
I suppose it <i>is</i> that."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, as far as one can see. I'm not a romantic
young girl, and he is just forty, has made one fortune
and lost it, and now is&mdash;well, he spends money
as if there would be no end to it. Do you remember
the old story of the bees that were taken to a place
where the flowers bloomed all the year round, and
ceased laying up honey? That seems the way with so
many here. There were people who lost everything
in the great fire and in no time were on their feet
again. It is in the air, I think, or perhaps the fusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of so many people from everywhere. And now Mr.
Personette is prospering, and I am to share the prosperity
and have a home of my own, and like the bees,
I'm not going to worry about the future. You see
I am already a recreant Yankee. Where is your little
girl?"</p>

<p>The little girl had been sitting on the window ledge
of the next room, and remembering the long journey
round the Horn, often cheered by the brightness of
Miss Alwood. She sprang down now and came forward.</p>

<p>"What a little dot she keeps! Laverne, I am going
to be your neighbor, and I am to have a little girl
who will be a playmate for you. I can't answer about
the other, girls begin to put on airs so soon. Do you
go to school?"</p>

<p>"No, I have taught her thus far. But it is rather
lonely for a child. There was no one about where we
lived, but some distance below a Spanish family which
hardly knew whether to affiliate or not."</p>

<p>"They are very brilliant farther down the coast.
Monterey is the place to see them in their glory. I
wish we had gone there, but Miss Personette hated the
strumming of a guitar and the click-clack of the language,
as she termed it. And now, can't you leave
household cares and come for a drive?"</p>

<p>"I have a splendid pony," said Laverne.</p>

<p>"Why, that is quite delightful. But you will not
disdain my carriage, I hope."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes rather hesitated, but Miss Alwood
overruled all the objections. And she remembered
that Mr. Chadsey said they need not expect him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
home to dinner. Now that he was so much nearer
he came back to an old-fashioned love for a midday
dinner.</p>

<p>First they went down to Mason Street. There was
quite a fine finished block of houses, detached, with
gardens on both sides. Down below it was unfinished
but the street had been straightened, the low places
were being filled up, the hillocks levelled.</p>

<p>"Oh," Miss Holmes began, with a depth of feeling
that touched her friend, "you can't think how glad
I am this has happened to you. We have had some
hard things in our lives, and now we have really gone
into a new world."</p>

<p>"And I wish you the same good luck. I did not
quite like your being buried down in that out-of-the-way
place."</p>

<p>"There were so few houses to be had when we
came."</p>

<p>"Yes; there were people living in tents. There are
a few of them now on the outskirts. And building
is going on everywhere. Oh, what do you suppose
it will be in twenty years?"</p>

<p>That really brought a stretch to the imagination and
they looked blankly at each other.</p>

<p>Improvements were going on everywhere with a
rush startling to these New England women.</p>

<p>There were new stores opened in the past two
months. They passed Russ Garden, one of the public
places near the Mission Road, devoted to amusements
of various kinds, and thronged on Saturday afternoons.
Down by the Plaza the "steam paddys" were levelling
the numerous sand hills that lay between that and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Happy Valley. Even the burned district of less than
a year ago was rising rapidly from its ashes.</p>

<p>"I've never had quite such a fine view of the town,"
Miss Holmes said. "Heretofore we have only taken
it in parts. What it will be when finished&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only New England cities get finished. I think I
have heard of some places that were fenced in and
whitewashed, but they must have been mere country
towns," declared Miss Alwood laughingly.</p>

<p>They made a call on Miss Gaines, who now had a
workroom full of girls and piles of dazzling material.
Nothing was too rich or too expensive for these California
dames, whose husbands made fortunes in a
month or cleared thousands of dollars in a day. Those
early years were an Arabian Nights' tale.</p>

<p>The three friends had a genial time together, and
then Miss Holmes and the little girl were set down at
their own door. She was very quiet.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" Miss Holmes asked
at length.</p>

<p>"Of the little girl Miss Alwood is to have, and
whether I shall like her. Of course, she will not be
like the Estenegas. And it seems queer to have a
new mother who isn't a real mother."</p>

<p>"You will understand that better by and by."</p>

<p>Laverne nodded. She could never have a new
mother. She wondered a little about her father.
Uncle Jason never spoke of him. Of course he was
dead also.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawson was very anxious to give Miss Alwood
a wedding feast, and indeed was fain to have her
married in the parlor, but she preferred the church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Mr. Personette was well known, and the church was
crowded. The two daughters walked in front and
strewed flowers in their path, there were congratulations
and good wishes, and a luncheon at the Dawson
House, when the new husband and wife took a short
journey, and ended the festivities by a reception at
their own home.</p>

<p>Laverne thought it was very fine to have a new
white frock, lace-trimmed, and a knot of blue ribbons
on one shoulder, with long streamers. Isabel Personette
was tall of her age, and quite a young lady,
rather pretty. Olive had large, dark eyes, and shining
chestnut hair, was round, plump, and merry-looking.</p>

<p>"Our new mother has been telling us about you,"
she began, grasping Laverne's hand. "And that you
came from Maine with her. What a long, long journey.
Weren't you awfully afraid? I looked up Maine
on the map. But you had to go round the Horn.
What did it look like?"</p>

<p>"It's a cape, you know."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I supposed there was something," in a surprised
tone. "Perhaps they blew a horn?"</p>

<p>"They didn't do anything as I remember," and
Laverne smiled a little.</p>

<p>"I've never been farther than Monterey. But
father went up to British Columbia once. It is desperately
cold up there. And there is a Russian country
where it is colder still. And you have snows in
Maine."</p>

<p>"Oh, dreadful snows that do not go off all winter,
and it seems so queer not to have any here. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
such fun to snowball and have sled-rides and build
snowhouses."</p>

<p>"You didn't live in them?" in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! But sometimes we brought in dry hemlock
branches and brush, and had a fire. It looks so
pretty."</p>

<p>"Didn't it melt the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a little. But you see it froze again."</p>

<p>"Which do you like best&mdash;there or here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is the most beautiful, for there are so
many flowers and lovely places. And&mdash;I think I like
the pleasant weather best."</p>

<p>"How many cousins have you?"</p>

<p>"None," answered Laverne rather regretfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that queer? I have four over to Oaklands.
And two in London. And one of father's sisters
married a Mexican, and lives way down to Santa
Barbara. They have ever so many children with queer
names. Aunt Amy died a little while ago, and as she
hadn't any children, she left some money to us and the
Oakland cousins. But not to have any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Olive Personette looked very sympathetic. Presently
she said, "How many little girls do you know?"</p>

<p>"Only three, and they are Spanish. There were
none where we lived before. It was a kind of wild
place. I like this ever so much better."</p>

<p>"Did you love them?"</p>

<p>Laverne considered, while her eyes wandered off
into space.</p>

<p>"I think I didn't really <i>love</i> them. I liked them.
They came up to learn English, and Miss Holmes and
I studied Spanish. And we played about. They had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
a queer old house and a lovely garden, with fruit and
flowers, and tame birds, and everything. And I had
a squirrel I tamed. We brought him up here, and I
kept him two weeks in a little pen, but when I let him
out he ran away."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do. We'll make believe to
ourselves that we are cousins. Mother said she hoped
I would like you a good deal. You see, Isabel begins
to go with big girls, and they just push you out
when they tell secrets, and they have so many to tell.
Do you know any secrets?"</p>

<p>Laverne shook her head gravely.</p>

<p>"But sometimes you do bad things and you don't
want to tell anybody."</p>

<p>"Why, I tell Uncle Jason everything. And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Did she ever do anything very bad? She didn't
always study when Miss Holmes told her to, and she
sometimes tore her frocks scrambling up or down the
hills. She had been brought up to be truthful and
obedient, and now these traits were part of her nature.</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way&mdash;you must not tell your uncle
the things I tell you, and you must find something to
tell me&mdash;when Miss Holmes is cross to you."</p>

<p>"But she isn't ever cross."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, everybody has a cross streak in her, or
him. I'm cross often. And I do hope our new
mother won't scold. Father said she was so good to
Aunt Amy, and Aunt Amy was dreadful at times.
Then the Mrs. Barr we had for housekeeper was just
awful. She said naughty words, too, like the men.
No one is good always. You can't be. And when I
get in a taking I'm a terror at school. Miss Carson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
once wrote a note to father, but I begged so she tore it
up. I wanted a watch for Christmas and I was afraid
he would not give it to me if he knew. That was a
secret I've kept until now, but he gave me the watch.
I let it fall and it had to go away to be repaired. And
I have three rings. See, are they not pretty? That
garnet is getting tight. I'll have to give it away," and
she laughed.</p>

<p>Her new mother came around to them.</p>

<p>"Are you making friends?" she asked. "That is
right. Laverne, are you having a nice time? Come
and see the dancing."</p>

<p>They were waltzing up and down the spacious hall.
There had been dancing on shipboard among the men,
but this was something that fascinated the little girl.
The beautiful dresses and sparkling jewels, the delicate
laces that floated like clouds, and among the men
were two or three young Spaniards. One of them
wore a beautiful fringed sash about his waist.</p>

<p>"Do you go to dancing school?</p>

<p>"No," replied Laverne.</p>

<p>"But you will. I began last winter. Isabel dances.
See, some one has taken her out. Oh, dear, I wish I
could grow up in a night, just three years. Wouldn't
it be funny to have it happen in your sleep?"</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey had been looking about for his little
girl. He had insisted at first that he could not come,
that he was too old, and such a plain fellow, that he
would look queer among the fine people. But Mrs.
Personette had written him a special invitation, and he
had compromised with Miss Holmes by promising to
come for them. He knew Mr. Personette a little in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
a business way, and he was really gratified at Miss Alwood's
good fortune. So he had gone to the tailor's
and treated himself to a new suit of clothes, and looked
fully five years younger.</p>

<p>Laverne stared at him a moment, then a lovely smile
illumined her face as she slipped her hand in his and
rather bashfully introduced her new friend.</p>

<p>"I have been making the acquaintance of your
brother and your sister," he said. "I hope you and
my little girl will be friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, we have promised to," declared Olive. "I
am coming to see her pony, and I am very glad to know
her."</p>

<p>He nodded and escorted the children about, or
rather followed Olive, who gracefully made herself
mistress of the occasion and chatted with an ease that
amused him. But it was getting late, and as he had
performed his round of duties, he proposed now that
they should return home. Olive kissed her new friend
with much fervor.</p>

<p>"Parties are just splendid," Laverne said, as she
danced alongside of Uncle Jason. "Can't you have
a party unless you are married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there are birthday parties and Christmas
parties and parties just for fun."</p>

<p>"But you have to know a good many people, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I think I have seen three or four little girls have
a party."</p>

<p>"I know four now."</p>

<p>"And perhaps by Christmas you will know four
more," returned Uncle Jason.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>She was very tired and sleepy when she reached
home, and they all retired. And it so happened she
slept late the next morning and had her breakfast alone.
Pablo had found it very lonely without them and had
decided to accept Mr. Chadsey's offer. So she ran out
now to say good-morning to him and Pelajo.</p>

<p>Something scampered along at her feet, and then
made a sudden dash among the vines. Two bright
eyes peeped out and there was a peculiar little chatter.</p>

<p>"Why, if it isn't Snippy," she cried. "Snip, Snip!"
and she knelt down in the gravelly path. "Snip!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden rush, and the squirrel ran up
her arm, across her shoulders, and fairly nestled in
the little curve below her ear. And then he began to
chatter as if he was telling over his journey and his
tribulations and expressing his joy. Surely no squirrel
was ever more eloquent to his mate in love-making
time. Laverne laughed until the tears came into her
eyes, and she had a vague suspicion that she was crying
as well, but it was for very joy.</p>

<p>Snippy wriggled out of the warm embrace presently
and questioned her with his bright beady eyes, as if the
voice might have led him into a mistake. But no, this
was his little mistress sure enough.</p>

<p>She gathered him up and ran into the kitchen where
Miss Holmes was making a pie.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "Snippy has come back, my dear,
darling Snippy."</p>

<p>He had come by his name in a rather unexpected
fashion. When Laverne first had him tame enough
to come into the house, throw his beautiful bushy
tail up his back, and let the feathery end droop over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
ears like a bit of Spanish lace, a trick of the Señoras,
and eat a fragment of cracker, Miss Holmes said one
day, "He looks so pert and snippy one has to smile at
his daintiness."</p>

<p>They had tried on several names that did not seem
to fit. It was easy enough to get something for a dog
or a horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, that will just do, Snippy," and Laverne
danced around in delight. "Then we can call him
Snip when we are in a hurry&mdash;he is such a dear little
dot, too. His tail is as big as his body; Snippy,
Snippy!"</p>

<p>Perhaps there was something in the sound that attracted
him, for he glanced up out of brightest eyes and
winked as if he approved it.</p>

<p>He did soon come to know his name. Perhaps it
was because it became connected with some tidbit, for
when the little girl called him she always had a dainty
morsel for him.</p>

<p>He glanced about the room now, and then thrust
his head under Laverne's arm. Miss Holmes spoke
and he peered out. Yes, he knew that voice surely,
but the place was strange.</p>

<p>"Oh, Snippy, you can't imagine how glad I am to
have you. I've been homesick for you, though I like
this place better, and we're nearer the grand ocean, and
can look over into the Golden Gate, and golden it is
in the sunset. Oh, why did you run away?"</p>

<p>Snippy said something in his own language and
struggled to get free. She let him run down her skirt
and leap to the floor. He glanced round with sharp,
inquiring eyes, then ran to one corner where, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
old place, he used to find nuts and perhaps a crust.
Oh, it wasn't the same place. He fairly scolded, up
went his tail, and he scampered out of the door. Laverne
ran, calling him. Over the path, the rockery
Uncle Jason had built for her, plunging into the great
ferns that grew as high as her head, and shook off an
odorous fragrance at being disturbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Snippy! Snippy!" in a beseeching tone.</p>

<p>The little girl sat down on a stone and cried. Sorrow
had followed so on the heels of delight. Bruno
came and put his nose in her hand and looked comfort
out of great wistful eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes came out presently.</p>

<p>"I think he will come back," she said hopefully.
"You see he found the way once and he can again.
And now come in and study a lesson. There is nothing
like work to lighten sorrow."</p>

<p>"If he only would come back! Bruno, if you see
him, come and tell me at once."</p>

<p>Bruno nodded sagaciously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
A TASTE OF GAYETY</h2>

<p>May was beautiful enough to make the heart leap for
joy. Rose-bushes sent up spikes of pink and blood-red
blossoms or clambered over hillocks, lilies stood up
among the ferns and bushes, and the poppies that grew
everywhere seemed to dance with joy, as they flung out
their silken leaves in a dazzle, wooed by the wind.
Bees were busy enough with their bustle and humming,
birds were singing everywhere. Squirrels and rabbits
scudded about, little harmless lizards came out and
sunned themselves on the stones, and great flying iridescent
bugs that shot across the air with golden and
green rays. Oh, how enchanting it all was. It stirred
the little girl with unutterable thoughts.</p>

<p>"Laverne," Miss Holmes called. Oh, was it lesson
time!</p>

<p>"Come, dear, Mrs. Personette has the carriage here,
and we are going to take a look at the great German
Mayday festival. Come quick, and slip in another
frock."</p>

<p>For what with building dams for waterfalls, making
paths and rockeries and flower beds, the little girl was
not always in company trim.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Jason was talking about that, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
was so sorry he could not get away, but some vessels
were coming in. Oh, yes, I'll hurry."</p>

<p>There were baths and sundry conveniences in many
of the houses in this new city. Perhaps no place in the
world had ever worked such marvels in five years. But
Jason Chadsey had not come to luxuries yet. However,
the little girl did very well without them. She washed
and dressed in a trice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Personette and Olive were in the big carriage.
Isabel and Howard had taken the buggy. She greeted
them cordially. Olive made room for Laverne, or
rather beckoned her to her own seat.</p>

<p>The Germans were holding a grand festival at
Russ's Garden. There was a big flag flying from the
great marquee, and numerous lesser ones. There were
the park of shade trees, the houses of refreshment, the
arches wreathed with flowers, and German flags vying
with the Stars and Stripes. Gay beds of flowers were
interspersed that lent richest coloring. The broad
driveway was thronged with carriages already, but
none were allowed inside.</p>

<p>The <i>Turner Gesang Verein</i> was really the leader of
the festivities. The members were dressed in brown
linen, loose and baggy, and marched from their headquarters
with banners flying and the band playing inspiriting
airs from Vaterland. And when they all assembled
before the marquee, "<i>Das Deutsche Vaterland</i>"
swelled out on the balmy air in a most rapturous
manner. They were in their home atmosphere again,
they hardly remembered the land giving them shelter.
The grand choruses went up in a shout. The instruments
seemed fairly to beat waves of music on the air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>It appeared, indeed, as if all the Germans in the city
had gathered there, and even at this time there were
about two thousand. And then the games began.
They leaped and balanced, they performed various
athletic feats, the victor being crowned with shouts, as
well as winning a prize. They danced, the boys and
men with each other, many of them in native garments
of the provinces from which they had emigrated, and
some were amusing in motley array.</p>

<p>Outside there were booths with tables for refreshments,
where wives and children congregated, and the
place was patrolled by policemen to keep roughs away.
The onlookers drove around or were on horseback;
among them were the old Californians in leggings,
sash, and sombrero, and a few Spaniards, who looked
on haughtily at these people who were fast superseding
the old stock.</p>

<p>There were not many places of amusement really
proper for women and children of the better class. The
circus had been the pioneer entertainment, then the
theatre. Even at a concert of vocal music given by
the favorite, Stephen C. Massett, where front seats were
reserved for ladies, only four were present. A neat
little theatre had been destroyed by fire; the Jenny Lind
had shared the same fate, until a Mr. Maguire erected
a large stone theatre destined for first-class amusements
and that had been taken for the city hall. But the year
before Mr. and Mrs. Baker, fine actors, had succeeded
in establishing a new era in the Californian drama, and
given it a style and excellence, and catered to the best
class of people, who had begun to give tone to society.</p>

<p>Laverne hardly heeded Olive's chatter, she was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
interested in the gay scene. There had never been anything
like it to her. And the music stirred her wonderfully.
They drove slowly round and round,
watched the athletes and held their breath at some of
the daring feats.</p>

<p>"Oh, you should hear Howard talk of the circus performers
and what they do," exclaimed Olive. "There's
a flying leap when a man comes over the head of the
audience, and catches a big hoop on the stage, and
hangs suspended while the audience applauds, and a
woman that rides on two horses, changing about,
and sometimes stands up. She's a foreigner of some
sort."</p>

<p>"I should think they would be afraid;" and Laverne
shuddered.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; they're trained, you see. And the races
are splendid. We can go to them. And they used to
have bull-baits at the Mission, but they don't allow it
now."</p>

<p>"Bull-baits?" echoed Laverne.</p>

<p>"Oh, bull-fights," laughed Olive. "That's real
Spanish, you know. Why, it seems all right to them, of
course. And there are dog-fights and cock-fights here&mdash;I
don't see much difference, only the bulls are bigger
and stronger."</p>

<p>Then a Turk halted at the carriage which had been
stopped in the press. He had a great clapper, which
made a hideous noise, and a voice that went through
your ears. A tray was suspended from a leathern strap
that passed around his neck. He wore a gay fez, and
a jacket embroidered with gold thread much tarnished,
and full Turkish trousers of red silk so soiled one could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
hardly tell the color. His swarthy skin and long,
waxed mustache gave him a fierce look.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, get some candy," cried Olive, "I'm
just dying for some."</p>

<p>Fortunately it was done up in a kind of soft Chinese
paper, and so kept from the dust. Then in a jar he had
some curious shredded stuff that looked like creamy
ravellings.</p>

<p>"Oh, we will drive around and get some at Winn's,"
said her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, Laverne, don't you want some real Turkish
candy?"</p>

<p>Laverne looked undecided.</p>

<p>"Oh, do, do," pleaded Olive, and Mrs. Personette
yielded.</p>

<p>The ravelly stuff was very funny and melted in your
mouth, and the candy seemed saturated with all flavors.</p>

<p>"Of course, Winn's is much better," declared Olive,
with an air. "Oh, mother, can't we go to Winn's and
have some lunch!"</p>

<p>"I've been considering that," returned her mother.</p>

<p>The two friends had so much to talk about that
the children's chatter had not really reached them.
Old times and beliefs that seemed of some bygone
century rather than a decade or two, so utterly had this
Western coast outgrown them.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Howard anywhere?" asked Mrs.
Personette.</p>

<p>"No," returned Olive. Then in a lower tone&mdash;"They're
off, having a good time, I know. Let Isabel
alone for that; mother needn't think she'll know everything,"
and the girl laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>They drove around once more. Now a good many
were seated at the refreshment tables, smoking, drinking
beer, and laughing over jokes of the old fatherland.
Of course, before night they would be rather uproarious.
They had seen the best part of the celebration.</p>

<p>"I do wish we could find the children," said Mrs.
Personette. "We might have lunch together."</p>

<p>At Washington and Montgomery Streets was the
new establishment of Mr. Winn, who had been twice
burned out and had not lost his courage. It seemed the
fate of nearly all of the old settlers, and would have
ruined and discouraged a community with less pluck.
For, after all, while there were no end of toughs and
roughs and adventurers, there was still some of the best
blood of the Eastern cities, full of knowledge and perseverance.</p>

<p>Winn's was a large refectory of the highest order.
It was furnished in the most elegant and tasteful manner,
and the service was admirable. Indeed, it had
come to be quite a calling place for the real society
people, where they could meet a friend and sit over
their tea or coffee and exchange the news of the day,
which meant more really than in any other city. For
every twenty-four hours something stirring was happening.
Every fortnight now a steamship came in.
New people, new goods, letters from the States, messages
to this one and that from friends thousands of
miles away.</p>

<p>The large rooms were connected by arches with
costly draperies. Tables here and there for guests,
sofas, easy-chairs, a stand for flowers, the papers of
the day and magazines that had to be old before they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
reached these Western readers. Silks and satins
rustled, skirts were beginning to be voluminous, bonnets
had wreaths of flowers under the brim, and it was
the day of shawls, India, cashmere, and lace. Now
and then a dark-eyed Señorita wore hers in some
graceful folds that made a point over the curls on her
forehead. But women mostly had their hair banded
Madonna-wise that gave some faces a very serene and
placid look. Long ringlets were another style. Demi-trains
were also in vogue, and at Winn's at luncheon
time, it had the appearance of a fashionable reception.
Children wore stiffly starched skirts and gypsy hats
with wreaths of flowers. Laverne's were forget-me-nots,
with streamers of blue ribbon, and her soft light
hair was braided in two tails, tied with a blue ribbon
about halfway, the rest floating loose.</p>

<p>They had a dainty luncheon. Mrs. Personette received
nods from this one and that one, for already she
was becoming quite well known.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said presently, "do you know the school
children are to have their walk on Monday, a Mayday
walk, quite an institution, I believe. And Laverne
ought to go to school, do you not think so? And this
is to be quite an event. She must see it, and you as
well."</p>

<p>"Alice Payne is to be Queen of the May, and seven
maids of honor from the different schools," said Olive.
"Why, I could take Laverne with me. You'd have to
wear your white frock, that's all."</p>

<p>Laverne glanced up eagerly, with a dainty flush.
Could she really take part in it?</p>

<p>It was true Jason Chadsey had not been very anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to push his little girl forward. They had lived too far
from schools before, and she was too much of a
stranger to go around alone.</p>

<p>"It will be just splendid! And you will see so many
girls. Of course, we have lived here a long while and
know almost everybody."</p>

<p>"Of all the thousands," appended her mother, rather
humorously. "Then you must be a 'Forty-niner.'"</p>

<p>Olive colored. "We're older than that," she answered,
with some pride. "Father is a real Californian."</p>

<p>"And you children will belong to the old aristocracy
when birth begins to count. I suppose that will come
in presently."</p>

<p>"It always does," returned Miss Holmes. "Think
of the pride of Boston over her early immigrants."</p>

<p>They drove around the garden and then took the two
guests home. Miss Holmes expressed her pleasure
warmly.</p>

<p>"Oh," laughed Mrs. Personette, "when we were on
our long journey, coming to a strange land, who could
have imagined that in so short a time I should be riding
round in my carriage! And I seemed to have
no special gift or attraction. Truly it is a Golden
State."</p>

<p>Laverne had a great deal to tell Uncle Jason. She
was so bright and happy, and had seen so much. And
then there was the procession for Monday. Could she
go?</p>

<p>Certainly, it was not possible to deny the eager, appealing
face and pleading voice.</p>

<p>After supper, when she was in bed and Uncle Jason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
reading his papers, Miss Holmes broached the subject
of school.</p>

<p>The first schools, as happens in most new places, were
private enterprises. The earliest of all had been among
the old residents before the great influx, and in 1847
the old plain little schoolhouse was erected on Portsmouth
Square. It was used for many purposes. Religious
bodies held their first meetings here, and the early
public amusements were given, even political and benevolent
assemblies. It was dignified as a Court House
under Judge Almond, and at length turned into a
station house until it went the way of transitory things.
To this effort for education succeeded a real public
school, with a board of trustees of prominent men, there
being sixty children of school age in a population of a
little over eight hundred, including Indians. Then
suddenly the gold fever swept the town like wildfire,
the public-school project was dropped, and the Rev.
Albert Williams collected twenty-five pupils into a pay-school.
In the spring of 1850, Mr. and Mrs. Pelton,
who had succeeded the clergyman, and gathered in a
large number of pupils, applied to the city for adequate
recompense, and it was virtually made a public school.
In January, a beautiful lot at Spring Valley, on the
Presidio Road, was purchased, and a school was built
in a delightful road of evergreens.</p>

<p>Soon after this the city started again and in time had
seven schools, though several private schools were in a
very flourishing condition. But many children were
sent East to finishing academies, or to Monterey and
other Southern towns to convent schools. Still the
cause of education began to demand more attention, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the necessity for good citizenship became more strenuous.</p>

<p>Uncle Jason glanced up from his paper when Miss
Holmes spoke of the school.</p>

<p>"Not that I find it at all troublesome to teach her,
and she is the most tractable child I ever saw. Then
she is so eager to get to the very foundation of things.
Why, you would hardly believe how much she knows
about botany. I found an old book&mdash;but the flowers
here are so different. And I really love to teach now
that I am well and strong. I could almost go in school
again."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't think of such a thing. We couldn't do
without you," he exclaimed earnestly. "But you
think&mdash;a school&mdash;&mdash;" and he paused, his eyes fixed on
the floor as if he was ruminating.</p>

<p>"Laverne needs the companionship of children, comparing
thoughts with them, playing, the harmless
rivalry of studying together. When it comes to that,
I could have a small school. You see she will be growing
older all the time."</p>

<p>"Frankly, which would be best? You are more
capable of deciding, since you have had a wider experience
in this matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, the school. You see she must take a place
with other people. She has no relatives, and friends
must stand in their stead."</p>

<p>He turned back to his paper, but he was not reading.
The little girl was all his. He had a feeling when they
left Maine that nothing and no one should come between
them. Every thought, every desire should
cluster about her. He would make a fortune for her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
His first plan in going to California was to start to the
gold fields for the sake of adventures. He would cut
loose from all old recollections. He would leave
Laverne Westbury a comfortable and satisfied wife and
mother. He had no bitterness against his rival now.
It had all been so different. Many a night on shipboard
he lived over those few sad weeks and hugged
to his heart the consolation that she had loved him, and
that fate had been cruel to both. And then, conscious
of the finer strain of fatherhood that had so long lain
fallow in his soul, the child slipped into the place, and
aims were changed for him. There would be enough
for him to do in the new town where everything was
needed, and he could turn his hand to almost anything.
But he must keep to her, she was the apple of his eye,
and he would go groping in sorrowful darkness without
her.</p>

<p>He had a curious feeling at first that he must hide
her away lest her father should start up from somewhere
and claim her, and was glad to light on that out-of-the-way
place. The long voyage had been like living
in the same village with these people. The New
England reticence of Miss Holmes appealed to him in
a peculiar manner, he was reticent himself. Then the
child took the greatest fancy to her. She was rather
timid about this new world while the others were ready
for adventures. And when he offered her a home for
the care of the child she was very willing to accept it
for the present. Her belief was that when she was
rested and in her usual health she should teach school
again.</p>

<p>Her two friends had teased her a little about finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
a possible lover in Jason Chadsey. She had the fine
feminine delicacy that shrank from the faintest suspicion
of putting herself in the way of such a possibility.
He was a sturdy, upright, plain-spoken fellow, not at
all her ideal, and she still had the romance of girlhood.
She came to know presently by her womanly intuition
that marriage had no place in his thoughts, that were
centred in the little girl. Perhaps, her mother was
his only sister, a deserted wife, she gathered from
childish prattle of Laverne's. She knew so little about
her past. Uncle Jason had come when they were in
great want, and her mother had died. And now, Jason
Chadsey knew it would be best for this idea to gain
credence. He would always be her uncle.</p>

<p>But he had some duties toward her. She could not
always remain a child, a plaything. That was the
sorrow of it. There must be a rich, delightful life before
her. She must have the joys her mother had
missed, the prosperity that had not come to her.</p>

<p>He looked up from the paper presently.</p>

<p>"About the school," he began. "Yes, I have been
considering it. And you will have quite enough to do
to keep the house and have the oversight of her; I will
make it an object for you to stay. We get along comfortably
together, though sometimes I feel I am a queer
unsocial Dick, much occupied now with business. But
it is all for her. She is the only thing out of a life that
has been all ups and downs, but, please God, there'll
be some clear sailing now. I like San Francisco. I
like the rush and bustle and newness, the effort for a
finer civilization that has strength and purpose in it.
Heaven knows there is enough of the other sort, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the dross does get sifted out and the gold is left. It
will be so here, and these earnest men ten years hence
will be proud of the city they are rearing."</p>

<p>He glanced at her steadily, forgetting he had wandered
from the main question.</p>

<p>"You will not leave us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, no;" yet she colored a little.</p>

<p>"There will be enough to do if the child does go to
school. And you can walk down for her in the afternoon,
wherever it is, and have little outings. I am
glad you are so fond of her, and she loves you. She
isn't the kind to strew her love broadcast."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very fond of her," was the reply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<br />
GIRLS AND GIRLS</h2>

<p>They rambled over the hills on Sunday, for Miss
Holmes had given her ankle a little wrench and was
applying hot fomentations. Up there was the Presidio,
and over here the beautiful ocean, blue as the
sky to-day, except where the swells drove up on the
rocks and, catching the sun, made spray of all colors.
The ground squirrels ran about, scudding at the slightest
sound of human beings, which they seemed to distinguish
from the rustling and whispering of the
trees, or the tinkle of a little stream over the stones.
It ran under a crevice in the rock that was splitting
apart now by some of Nature's handiwork and came
out over west of their house where it dropped into a
little basin. Here was a blasted pine that had been
struck by some freak of rare lightning, then piles of
sand over which cactus crept. And here was a deer-trail,
though civilization had pretty well scared them
away.</p>

<p>But the birds! Here was the jay with his scolding
tongue, the swallows darting to and fro in a swift
dazzle, the martins in bluish purple, the tanager in his
brilliant red, the robin, thrush, meadowlark, the
oriole, and the mocking birds that filled the air with
melody this May Sunday. And nearly every foot of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
ground was covered with bloom. Now and then the
little girl hopped over a tuft that she might not crush
the beautiful things. Great clouds of syringas and
clusters of white lilies filled the air with a delicious
fragrance. And the wild lilac with its spikes of bloom
nodding to the faintest breeze. Wild barley and wild
oats, and a curious kind of clover, and further down
the coarse salt grass with its spear-like blades.</p>

<p>They sat down on some stones and glanced over the
ocean. There were two vessels coming up the coast
and some seamews were screaming. It was all wild
and strange, almost weird, and no little girl could have
dreamed that in a few years streets would be stretching
out here. As for trolleys going to and fro, even
grown people would have laughed at such a thing.</p>

<p>They talked of the great procession that was to be
the next day. And then Uncle Jason wondered how
she would like going to school regularly.</p>

<p>"I shall like girls," she said. "There are no boys
where Olive goes. She thinks boys are more fun."</p>

<p>"But you don't go to school for the mere fun."</p>

<p>"They make so much noise in the street. And some
times they sing such funny songs. But they were nice
about sledding back home, only there's no snow here."</p>

<p>"Are you ever homesick?"</p>

<p>"You know I was sick sometimes on the ship."</p>

<p>"But to go back, I mean."</p>

<p>"There wouldn't be any one&mdash;I've almost forgotten
who were there. Mother, you know&mdash;&mdash;" with a pitiful
sort of retrospection.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Would you want to go?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" with some vehemence.</p>

<p>She came and leaned against his knee, put her arms
about his neck, and her soft cheek against his weather-beaten
one.</p>

<p>"I should never want to go anywhere without you,"
she replied, with grave sweetness.</p>

<p>"You are all I have, my little darling."</p>

<p>"And I haven't any one else. Olive has such a lot
of cousins. She goes over to Oaklands to see them."</p>

<p>There was a long pause and the wind rushed by
laden with perfumes. They heard the lapping of the
surf against the rocks. The strange beauty penetrated
both souls that were not so far apart after all.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jason, did you ever have a wife?" she asked,
with a child's innocence.</p>

<p>"No, dear." Sometime he would tell her the story
of his love for her mother.</p>

<p>"Then you won't want to marry any one?"</p>

<p>"Marry! I?" Had that Personette girl put some
nonsense into her head about Miss Holmes? He
colored under the weather-browned skin.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Personette's wife had died, and I
suppose he had to marry some one again to look after
the children."</p>

<p>"Would you like me to marry some one to look after
you?" in a half humorous tone.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Holmes can do that," she returned, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"She seems to do it very well." There was a lurking
smile about the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"I like her. No, I shouldn't like any one else coming
in. Perhaps she would not stay. No, Uncle Jason, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
don't want you to marry any one," she said, simply.
"And when I get old I shall not marry, though Carmen
means to. And we will live together always. Oh,"
with a bright little laugh, "let's promise. Put your
little finger&mdash;so." She hooked hers in it. "Now, you
must say: Honest and true, I love but you!"</p>

<p>He uttered it solemnly. He had said it to one other
little girl when he was a big boy.</p>

<p>Then she repeated it, looking out of clear, earnest
eyes.</p>

<p>After that she gathered a great armful of flowers
and they rambled off home.</p>

<p>"Who do you think has been here?" inquired Miss
Holmes, with a laugh in her very voice.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Olive, perhaps. Or, maybe, Dick Folsom."</p>

<p>"No. Guess again."</p>

<p>She cudgelled her wits. "Not Snippy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Snippy. He actually came into the house
and looked so sharply at me that I told him you would
be home about noon. Then I gave him a bit of cracker,
and when he had eaten a little he scampered off with
the rest. I think he has been planning a house near
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't that be splendid! I'm just going to
scatter a path of cracker bits as Hop o' my Thumb
did."</p>

<p>"But if he eats them up how much wiser will you
be?"</p>

<p>Laverne looked nonplussed. "Well, he will have
them at any rate," and she nodded her head with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Pablo had built a stone fireplace and was roasting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
some ducks out of doors. He was sure he couldn't do
it any other way.</p>

<p>"I must go and view the camping process," and
Uncle Jason laughed. "How is your ankle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite on the mend," she answered.</p>

<p>Pablo had built a stone fireplace and was roasting
the ducks over a great bed of coals that he was burning
at one side. It might be wasteful, as when the
Chinaman first roasted his pig, but it was filling the air
with a savory smell, and they were browned to a turn.</p>

<p>"They look just delicious," announced Laverne.
She took the platter out and Pablo carried them in with
a proud air.</p>

<p>And delicious they certainly were. The little girl
was hungry, and Uncle Jason said he had not enjoyed
anything so much in a long while. She insisted she
should wash up the dishes while Uncle Jason took his
usual nap. Then she went out and dropped some
cracker crumbs and strictly forbade Bruno to touch
them.</p>

<p>"If you would like to go down to the Estenegas I
will get one of the horses," Uncle Jason said. His
Sundays were always devoted to her.</p>

<p>So she went out and talked to Pelajo while Pablo
harnessed him. He said very plainly that she had quite
neglected him of late and he did not like it. He did not
want to be thrown over for new friends.</p>

<p>All along the road the beauty of the May met them,
and it stirred both riders, making them respond to the
joy of motion and the sweetness of all blooming things,
the merriment of the birds, the touch of the wind in
the trees as a voice playing on a flute. He thought it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
was all the delight of owning the little girl who would
always be his. How he would care for her in old age,
and he quite forgot that he would be there decades and
decades first. But he suddenly felt so young, with all
these signs of youth about him, the magnetism of the
air in this wondrous land.</p>

<p>Here was the old house. They were straightening
the road, digging away hills, filling up hollows, and a
corner of it had tumbled down. There seemed a damp,
marshy smell of the newly turned earth, and two trees
had fallen and begun to wither up. The wood doves
were calling plaintively.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't come back for anything!" cried
Laverne. "Did we have nice times here, and did we
really like it?"</p>

<p>"This is the hand of improvement. Sometime, when
we are trotting over a nice level road, with pretty
houses and grounds, we shall admire it again."</p>

<p>But it was lovely enough at the Estenegas, out of
doors. The children were wild with delight. It
seemed as if Carmencita had suddenly shot up into a
tall girl. And in the autumn she was to go to Monterey,
to the old convent, where Doña Conceptione de
Arguello had gone after her Russian lover had been
killed, and where she had finally become Mother Superior
and lived to old age, always praying for his soul.</p>

<p>"But I am going only for accomplishments. And
it seems the distant cousin of the Estenegas wishes a
wife who will grace the great house and carry on the
honors. Mamacita is very proud that he made the
offer. And the children will go up to the Mission to
stay all the week at the Sisters' School."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"And they must visit me sometimes. The new home
is so much pleasanter. I am going to school also, and
I have some new friends. It is splendid to be in the
heart of the city." Then she told them about the day
at Russ's garden, and that on to-morrow, Monday, she
was going out to walk with hundreds of children.</p>

<p>The Spanish girl's eyes grew larger and larger at all
the wonders. They walked up and down with their
arms about each other and were full of childish happiness.
Then Señora Estenega summoned them to refreshments
on the balcony, now a wilderness of roses.
Uncle Jason did not care much for the Spanish sweetmeats
and candied fruits, the freshly ripened ones were
more to his taste and he had been quite spoiled again
by New England living. But he knew how to be
polite.</p>

<p>It was quite dusk when they reached home. Olive
Personette had been over. They would call for her
to-morrow, and she was to be dressed in white, sure.
It would be a greater thing than the German Festival.</p>

<p>And great it surely was! There had never been
such an event in San Francisco. There were over a
thousand children, and each one carried a bouquet of
flowers. Miss Holmes had found some white ribbon
and trimmed her gypsy hat, and the little girl with her
fair hair looked like a lily. There were crowds of
people in the streets to see them, proud mothers and
aunts. Each school had a distinctive banner, and there
was a band of music. The Queen of May wore a
wreath, and so did her maids of honor.</p>

<p>When they had gone through the principal thoroughfares
and been cheered enthusiastically, they moved to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the schoolhouse on Broadway, where they had a little
sort of play dialogue, and sang some beautiful songs.
A few brief addresses were made, and San Francisco
declared itself proud of its children that day, the children
who were to be the future men and women of the
city.</p>

<p>Then there was quite a feast, which the young people
enjoyed mightily. How they laughed and talked and
declared they would not have missed it for anything.</p>

<p>Afterward they dispersed. The Personette carriage
was waiting, with instructions to take home all it would
hold, so they crowded in. And at the gate stood Uncle
Jason.</p>

<p>"Oh," the little girl exclaimed, with a tired sigh, "it
was just splendid. If you had only been there!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I would have missed it? I came up
to see the procession and I picked you out, walking
with Olive. Why, I was as proud of you as if you had
been the Queen."</p>

<p>"But the Queen was lovely. And the play! I
couldn't hear all of it, there was such a crowd, and
I had to stand up to see. Wasn't it good of Olive to
ask me! And she wanted to take me home to dinner."</p>

<p>"I couldn't have eaten dinner without you." He
kissed her over and over again. He was so glad to see
her happy. Not that she was ever a sad little girl.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes was very much improved and regretted
she could not have gone out to see the procession.
Snippy had called, and all the cracker bits were gone,
but she had seen the wood doves carrying off some of
the crumbs.</p>

<p>"I guess Snippy has moved for good," said Uncle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Jason. "It's rather funny, too. You must have
charmed him."</p>

<p>She gave a pleased laugh.</p>

<p>Nearly midnight of that happy day the bells rang
out with their dreadful alarm. Uncle Jason sprang
up, and before he was dressed he saw the blaze.
Citizens turned out <i>en masse</i>. The Rassete House on
Sansome Street was in a sheet of flame. A fine five-story
hotel, full of lodgers, who had to flee for their
lives. The firemen were quite well organized now and
made great efforts to keep it from spreading, remembering
the former big fires. In this they were quite
successful. Other generous people were taking in the
four hundred homeless ones, and it was found the next
day that no lives had been lost, which was a source of
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>A little later there were some imposing ceremonies
near the Presidio, just at the foot of the hill. This
was the commencement of the Mountain Lake Water
Works, a much-needed project. There were various
artesian wells, and water was brought in tanks from
Sausalito, but the supply was inadequate in case of fires
and the city was growing so rapidly. The rather
curious Mountain Lake was not large, but a short distance
from its northern margin a stream of water
gushed through the ground, which was a great spring
or a subterranean river from the opposite shores. It
was begun with great rejoicing, but like all large undertakings
it had progressed slowly.</p>

<p>Indeed, San Francisco had so many things on its
hands. There were plans for the State Marine Hospital
and other benevolent institutions. Churches too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
were urging demands on a generous people who felt
they must make an effort to redeem the standing of
the city. The toughs had been somewhat restrained,
but the continual influx of miners with their pouches of
gold, ready for any orgies after having been deprived
of the amenities of social life, and the emigration from
nearly all quarters of the globe constituted a class very
difficult to govern, who drank, gambled, frequented
dance houses, quarrelled, and scrupled not at murder.</p>

<p>But of this side the little girl was to hear nothing,
though Uncle Jason was often shocked in spite of all
his experiences. He was having a warehouse down on
the bay, fitting out vessels, disposing of cargoes, and
keeping the peace with one of those imperturbable
temperaments, grown wise by training of various sorts,
and the deep settled endeavor to make a fortune for the
Little Girl. It did not matter so much now, but when
she grew up she should be a lady and have everything
heart could desire.</p>

<p>In a short street that came to be called Pine afterward,
and was at the head of the streets that were to
be named after trees, there stood quite a substantial
brick building with some fine grounds. Here a Mrs.
Goddart and her sister, Miss Bain, kept a school for
young girls and smaller children, and had a few boarding
scholars. The Personette girls had gone there because
it was near by, and out of the range of the noisier
part of the city. Howard was at the San Francisco
Academy, kept by a Mr. Prevaux, in quite a different
direction. There was a plan for a new public school
on Telegraph Hill, but these were more largely filled
with boys, as is often the case in the youth of towns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>So the little girl went to Mrs. Goddart's and quite
surprised her teachers by her acquirements and her
love of study. Perhaps, if she had not lived so much
alone she would have been more interested in play and
childish gossip. And her walks with Uncle Jason had
brought her into companionship not only with trees
and flowers, but with different countries of the world,
and their products. Uncle Jason had grafted upon a
boy's common education the intelligence that travel and
business give, and though a quiet man he had taken a
keen interest not only in the resources of countries, but
their governments as well, and these things were the
little girl's fairy stories. She would find the places on
the map, the Orient, the northern coast of Africa, the
country of the Turks, Arabia, India. A trading vessel
goes from port to port.</p>

<p>She liked her school very much, though she was
rather shy of the girls. Some of them called her a
little prig because she would not talk and was correct
in her deportment. She found in the course of a few
days that Olive "squirmed" out of some things and
did not always tell the truth. Back in Maine children
had been soundly whipped for telling falsehoods and
it was considered shameful; Miss Holmes was a
very upright person, of the old Puritan strain.</p>

<p>She was not finding fault, but she did want to know
if a prig was something rather disgraceful.</p>

<p>"It is never disgraceful to be honest in word and
deed, to obey whatever rules are set before you, to
study honestly and not shirk. I think the prig would
set himself above his neighbors for this, but you see he
would only be doing his duty, he would have no extra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
claim. But when he set himself up to be better than
his neighbors and triumphed over them, he would be a
prig."</p>

<p>Her delicately pencilled brows worked a little.</p>

<p>"Some of them are ever so much prettier than I am,"
she said innocently, "and they say such funny things,
and their clothes are very nice. Well, I like them. We
have such fun playing at recess."</p>

<p>He remembered about the clothes and spoke to Miss
Holmes.</p>

<p>"I do not think it best to dress a child so much for
school. What will she have afterward? And it does
fill their heads with vanity."</p>

<p>He had given her a pretty ring for a birthday, and
she had her grandmother's string of gold beads that
had come over from London with some great, great-grandmother.</p>

<p>Snippy had settled himself quite comfortably, just
where they could not tell, and he had evidently coaxed
his wife to emigrate. She was not quite as handsome
as he. Dick Folsom, who ran up every now and then,
said he was what was called a hare squirrel, on account
of his splendid feathery tail, though why, he couldn't
see, as hares had scarcely any tail at all. Snippy was so
tame now, or else he was so glad to be near the little
girl, that he was not much afraid of strangers if they
did not offer to touch him. He would run around
Uncle Jason, and nose in his pockets until he found
nuts or crumbs. But he didn't like tobacco a bit and
scolded in his funny way when he came across that.</p>

<p>Pelajo was not forgotten, though he sometimes complained
a little. Uncle Jason said Miss Holmes must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
learn to ride. The big dray horse was not fit for a
lady, and though the Mexican and Indian women rode
mules and were very expert, they were not considered
quite the thing.</p>

<p>There was a stream coming out in a sort of split
rock up above the place, and it made a kind of pool just
below. In the autumn rains it ran along down the slope
of the ground, tumbling over the stones that were in
its way. Pablo and the little girl had made quite a
pretty waterfall and a new pond where the ducks could
swim about. The upper one they covered over and had
for family use. Springs were not very plentiful, and
Uncle Jason believed this a little underground spur of
the Mountain Lake, as it never quite dried up.</p>

<p>And one Saturday, when Laverne was working at
her stream, meaning to make it more extensive when
the rainy season set in, a great white something fell at
her very feet and gave such a screech that she started
and ran. It lay on the ground and fluttered and cried,
so she knew it was some kind of a bird and came nearer.
It looked up at her out of frightened black eyes, rose
on one foot, flapped one wing, and fell over again.
Was it really a gull?</p>

<p>She called Pablo.</p>

<p>"Yes, Señorita, it is a gull. I never could get
nearby one unless it was shot. They are the wildest
things. This have a leg broke," and he picked up the
limp member.</p>

<p>"Oh, the poor thing," softly stroking it.</p>

<p>"And wing too, see? Better kill it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! Poor thing," she cried, full of sympathy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"What then? He must die. He starve."</p>

<p>"No, we can feed him."</p>

<p>"But he eat fish."</p>

<p>"So do we. There is plenty of fish. And you
catch so many. Can't you do anything for him?"</p>

<p>Pablo lifted the leg again, and examined it.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;shot!" he exclaimed, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you do it up in splints?"</p>

<p>"Not worth it," and he shook his head decisively.
"And the wing too. Yes, that's shot."</p>

<p>Laverne patted the poor thing, who screeched and
tried to rise. How soft the feathers were and snowy
white, except about the neck that had the faintest shade
of blue. Then, suddenly, she picked it up in her skirt,
though it struggled. How light it was for such a large
thing. She had taken off her shoes and stockings
while she was paddling in the stream, and she ran down
to the house not minding the rough path.</p>

<p>"Oh, see this poor gull!" she cried. "It just
dropped down&mdash;out of the clouds, I guess. There were
no others around."</p>

<p>She laid it down on the patch of grass Miss Holmes
took great pains with for a bleachery.</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" said the lady pityingly.</p>

<p>"Better end him," and Pablo took hold of his neck.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! You shall not kill him. Poor fellow!"
she cried.</p>

<p>He was gasping now, and then he lay quite still,
exhausted.</p>

<p>"You could splint up his leg," said Miss Holmes.
"You did the duck, you know."</p>

<p>"That good for something. He squak and squak."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you must splint it up," Laverne said, with decision.
"I can find some cord, and&mdash;what will you
have?"</p>

<p>Pablo shrugged his shoulders and said something
just under his breath in pure Mexican, not quite the
thing for a little girl to hear.</p>

<p>"And when Uncle Jason comes home we will see
about the wing. Won't this old basket make splints?"</p>

<p>Pablo went about his job unwillingly. Laverne
wrapped him up so that he could not kick with the
other leg, and presently they had the wounded member
bandaged. The gull lay quite still, but Laverne saw
the frightened heart beat through the feathers.</p>

<p>Pablo raised the wing and shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jason is coming home early with the horses,
you know," she said to Miss Holmes. "Oh, my shoes
and stockings!" and off she ran to the spot where they
had been at work. "Pablo can go on clearing this
out," she said to herself. "It will be all ready when
the rainy season sets in. Oh, the poor flowers! Sun,
why do you scorch them up so! And in Maine the
summer is so delightful. But the winter, oh!" and she
made a half wry, half amused face.</p>

<p>She was all ready when Uncle Jason came up the
street on one horse and leading the other; and all
eagerness, she was telling her story while he dismounted
and fastened them both.</p>

<p>"That's funny," he said. "Next a black bear will
come knocking at your door. Or you might snare a
silver-gray fox and have a tippet made of his skin."</p>

<p>"As if I could be so cruel!"</p>

<p>The gull had hardly moved. Now, it seemed frightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
at the strange face and struggled. Uncle Jason
spoke softly, and lifted the wounded wing which was
considerably shattered.</p>

<p>"I suppose it <i>could</i> be mended, but there are hundreds
of gulls."</p>

<p>"This one came straight to me. Why, he fairly
asked me to take pity on him;" and she drew an eager
breath.</p>

<p>She was a very sympathetic little girl, and he smiled.</p>

<p>Some shot had better be taken out. He opened the
small blade of his knife. It was not a really fresh
wound, for the blood was dry. He picked out the shot,
scraped the pieces of bone a trifle, and studied how they
were to go together, Pablo holding the body tight.
He pulled out some of the downy feathers, pinched the
skin together, wound it with threads of soft silk and
then bound it up with splints.</p>

<p>"Poor thing," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe he will get over it? Oh, what if
he never could fly again."</p>

<p>"Then he will have to live with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I should like that if he would only be content."</p>

<p>Then they put him in a tub so he could not flounder
around much, and laid some bits of meat near him.
Pablo was to keep watch so that no evil would happen.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes had hardly mounted a horse since girlhood.
She did feel a little timid.</p>

<p>"She's a lady's mount and very gentle. Old knowledge
soon comes back to one," Uncle Jason said, with
an encouraging smile.</p>

<p>They took their way up on the cliff, where there was
a pretence of a road that long afterward was to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
magnificent. From here the town was a succession
of terraces to the bay. The houses were in many instances
hidden, but here and there a high one, or a
church, loomed up.</p>

<p>On the ocean side it was simply magnificent. The
wave-washed rocks glinting in the brilliant sunlight, the
seals diving, swimming about as if they were at play,
then coming up to sun themselves, the flocks of gulls,
the terns, the murres, and the fulmars, who expertly
catch fish from the gulls, the auks, diving and swimming
about. To-day almost every variety seemed out.</p>

<p>The air was like the wine of a new life and made the
blood tingle in the veins. The midday heat was over,
the west wind bore the tang of the broad ocean. Miss
Holmes wondered if she had ever known before this
just what life was, and the joy of living.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<br />
A PARTY AND AN ADMIRER</h2>

<p>When the sun dropped into the ocean the world for a
time seemed ablaze. Certainly, here was the place for
sunsets. And as they went on they crushed the dying
ferns and foot-high evergreens into penetrating fragrance.
Down below the Estenegas they turned
around and took a lower road that had little in it except
the whispering trees and plaintive bird songs, until
houses came into view, and human figures moving
about. They did not go down in the city, there was
always more or less carousing on Saturday night. A
strong young voice was shouting out a favorite song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Oh, Sally, dearest Sally; oh, Sally, for your sake,</p>
<p>I'll go to California and try to make a shake;</p>
<p>Says she to me, 'Joe Bowers, you are the man to win,</p>
<p>Here's a kiss to bind the bargain,' and she hove a dozen in."</p>
</div></div>

<p>There were musical voices, too. A square below
them a wagon load were singing to the accompaniment
of an accordion. Lights were flashing out, throngs
began to gather in the streets, and they were glad to
canter away to quiet.</p>

<p>"It is the most splendid thing of my life," Miss
Holmes said.</p>

<p>"And you have done exceptionally well. You and
Laverne can take many an hour's enjoyment when I
am busy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>Pablo took the horses down while Miss Holmes
spread the supper, and the two went to look after the
gull, who seemed very well content, and allowed his
neck to be stroked without demur.</p>

<p>"And we saw a great bird snatch a fish from one of
your kind," Laverne told him. "And such lots of
your relations!"</p>

<p>Bruno looked on curiously.</p>

<p>"Don't you touch him. And don't you let any wild
cat or fox come after him. Mind, now."</p>

<p>Bruno beat his tail on the dry grass.</p>

<p>If there were nations from almost every corner of
the globe, they all joined in celebrating Fourth of July.
This year there was a fine military parade, and Sutter's
Rifles from Sacramento City came up and passed in
review before the old true-hearted pioneer, Major-General
John H. Sutter, rapturously applauded by the
crowd. Then they marched to the Russ Garden,
where they were presented with a set of colors. Irish
and German were alike patriotic. There were singing
and speeches; booths on corners dispensed simple refreshments
to the weary and the children. Carriages
were ornamented with small flags, and filled with the
better class, who cheered as heartily. It was really a
gala day. They had been invited to the Personettes,
where tea was set out on the lawn, and as there was no
moon it was hung with Chinese lanterns. There were
some schoolgirls, and they had a table to themselves,
and some dancing. Several of the young people gave
the fancy dances they had learned at the classes the
winter before.</p>

<p>Vacations had generally commenced. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
picnics to San José and mountain climbs; there were
excursions up and down the bay and to the towns
opposite up to San Pablo and Mare's Island, over
to Sausalito. And on Sunday, the road to the old Mission
Dolores was always thronged with pleasure-seekers,
elegant open carriages filled with finely-dressed
ladies, equestrians of all kinds, and the Spanish señors
often disported themselves in all their bravery. Miss
Holmes was rather startled at first, and to her it was
Sabbath-breaking, but Jason Chadsey was so used to
the cosmopolitan order of the day, and she met the
people who had been to church in the morning.</p>

<p>The hot sun and lack of rain had not dried up everything.
There were fogs on the coast that dripped
like fine rain, and fairly drenched bush and faded grass.
There were fine green hills and fields of flowers, and
the new crop of wild oats and barley.</p>

<p>And then autumn came in again, schools opened,
business stirred up, there were blessed rains, and it was
like a later summer.</p>

<p>The little girl had been much interested in her gull
and he had grown very fond of her, eating out of her
hand, and hiding his head under her arms as the
squirrel did. She had traced Snippy to his home, and
sure enough he had a companion. There was an old
scrubby dead pine in which there was a hollow, or they
had gnawed it, and thither they carried nuts and crusts
of bread that Laverne pretended to lose.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jason," she said one day, "did you ever see
an albatross?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Not very often. They are in the Northern
Pacific."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>"They are not like gulls."</p>

<p>"Oh, much larger."</p>

<p>"There is a story about one. Miss Bain has it in
a beautiful book. One day she read it."</p>

<p>"Oh, 'The Ancient Mariner.'"</p>

<p>"Do you know about it?" Her face was alight
with pleasure. "And is it true? Did he kill the
bird:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'Who, every day for food or play,</p>
<p>Came to the Mariner's hollo.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"It's a queer story. No, I don't suppose it was
really true. But it is always considered bad luck to
kill one. I must get the book for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you would," in her pretty, coaxing way.
"Pablo wanted to kill the gull. Then we might have
had bad luck. And now we can't find any name for
him."</p>

<p>"That's bad, too."</p>

<p>His leg had mended nicely and the splints were off,
though it must be confessed he had tugged a great deal
at them, and could not be brought to understand their
benefit, though it was explained over and over again.
But his wing did not seem to be just right, and his
efforts to fly were not successful.</p>

<p>"But I wish he could. He would look so lovely
sailing about."</p>

<p>"And fly away!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't really believe he would."</p>

<p>Uncle Jason brought home a fine illustrated copy of
the "Ancient Mariner" from an English press. In
the early fifties, even in vaunted New York, Boston,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
and Philadelphia illustrating had not reached the high
point of art it was destined to later on.</p>

<p>She was delighted and in a little while knew it all
by heart. She grew very fond of poetry. She used
to read to the gull until he seemed hypnotized, and
presently would nod, sometimes put his head under his
wing.</p>

<p>In September, there was another great celebration
on the opening of the first electric telegraph. This
was between San Francisco and Point Lobos, and was
erected by Messrs. Sweeny and Baugh to give early
information of shipping arrivals. They had a station
on Telegraph Hill in which they used various signals,
but this was of immeasurably greater service.</p>

<p>Early in November, there was the anniversary of
the founding of the Mission of Dolores. There were
a number of Catholic children in the school, and a holiday
was given.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, go," Olive coaxed. "Eulogia Garfias
and her mother are going, and we are great friends.
You've never been in a Catholic Church?"</p>

<p>"No; but I know some Catholic girls, and one has
gone to a convent to be educated. Oh, and the two
little ones were to come up to the Sisters' School."</p>

<p>"Why, maybe they will be there."</p>

<p>She had not been to the Estenegas in a long, long
time; since the day she and Uncle Jason had ridden
down there.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes made no objection. People grew
broader in this grand air. There were many points
in which all denominations worked together for the
city's welfare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>It was constructed of adobe, partly whitewashed.
It had been very grand in its day, and had a capacious
interior. The walls and roof roughly painted still held
saints and angels and sacred subjects much faded by
the seventy-five years. The damp earthen floor struck
a chill to one. Some of the ornaments of the great
altar had been carried away, and those left were of no
great value. But on this occasion every year there
was a large accession of worshippers, even Spanish
and Mexican men as well as women, kneeling reverently
on the floor, and that seemed strange to Laverne,
who glanced up with great awe to the figure of
the Christ on the cross between the two oriel windows.
At the side was a female figure with hands clasped, the
Virgin. Tall candles were burning on each side of
the altar.</p>

<p>The service was mostly in Latin. The congregation
went out reverently, some to walk in the small graveyard.
Yes, there were Juana and Anesta and several
other girls, attended by a sister. They were delighted
to meet Laverne, and were full of confidences as they
walked out to the street. The house was shut up,
their mother had gone to Monterey, and they were
staying at school all the time. They liked it so much.
And, if they were allowed, they would be so glad to
visit Laverne. Eulogia Garfias knew the sister
and introduced her schoolmates; that made the
sister soften somewhat to them, and listen to their
plea.</p>

<p>So Laverne had quite an eventful morning.</p>

<p>"But the little girls look sad, I think," she commented.
"And the old church isn't a bit pretty, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
looks faded. And no seats to sit on. It didn't seem
at all like church."</p>

<p>What with lessons, her pets, and her rides, the days
were all too short. Her gull still remained and now
could fly a short distance. It really seemed to love
the shelter of the house, and this amused Uncle Jason
very much. Then it never flapped its wings, but
seemed to rise slowly and float about with a serene
air. It enjoyed the stream and the new lake Pablo and
Laverne had made. For now the frequent rains
swelled all the streams, and the bright bracing northwest
winds brought the fragrance of spring. Everything
grew by bounds. The little girl could hardly
believe it was winter. The bluest skies, the golden
sunshine that flashed in streams of brilliance, the bay
a sea of silver bearing on its bosom treasures of every
land.</p>

<p>And so came in a Merry Christmas, with pleasure in
every home; a children's festival, with not so much
religious significance as now. They went to a grand
dinner at Mrs. Personette's, Miss Gaines with them,
who looked splendid in her satin gown, and who was
coining money rapidly. Lines were not very closely
drawn; the aristocrat of to-day riding round in his
carriage was the workman of last year. The poor
mechanic lucky enough to find a nugget of gold
brought his wife in the front rank and dressed her in
velvet, loaded her with jewels. The keeper of an
ordinary restaurant branched out presently in a very
respectable hotel. It was difficult to keep up with all
the changes. Then, it must be admitted, that many of
these people were from the East and had good educations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
had, indeed, been accustomed to the refinements
of civilized life, but the thought of making a fortune
in a few years had given them courage to breast the
vulgarity and rough life until they could advance
themselves to the old standard.</p>

<p>The children had a party in the evening. Howard
had gone to a preparatory school in the East, as his
keen-eyed stepmother found he was in a rather dangerous
circle of young men&mdash;girls, too, for that matter&mdash;who
were likely to lead one astray, and this had also
influenced Isabel and was bringing her forward much
more rapidly than was judicious. So they were principally
schoolgirls, with the cousin from Oaklands
and the young sons of a few friends and neighbors.
At first Isabel was rather stiff and important, but she
thawed presently. Mrs. Personette remembered her
own youth and how much these pleasures had been to
her, and really exerted herself in a delightful manner
to keep them well entertained.</p>

<p>Victor Savedra, one of the cousins from Oaklands,
took a great fancy to the shy little girl, and asked her
to dance.</p>

<p>"I don't know how," she said, flushing and drawing
back.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;don't you dance?" in surprise.</p>

<p>"Just a little, with the girls at school. But&mdash;I am
afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll take you through. This is just the
plainest quadrille. Oh, Aunt Grace, don't you think
this&mdash;" little girl, he was about to say&mdash;"your name is
Laverne, isn't it&mdash;can't she dance? She looks as if she
could&mdash;she's as light as a feather."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you can never learn younger. All the children
dance here. I think it comes natural. But you
are too late for that. And, Victor, you might be explaining
the figures to her and be ready for the next
one."</p>

<p>Victor led her a little to one side. "Aunt Grace is
just a trump," he said. "We thought at first we
shouldn't like her, some of the Yankees are so queer,
and talk so outlandish and all that, through their noses,
you know, but she is just a lady all through, and full
of fun. Now, look at this&mdash;it's an easy figure&mdash;balancing
to corners, turning your partner and a galop
down the middle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, it's like the fairy rings you read about&mdash;I
have a splendid fairy book uncle brought me, and on
moonlight nights the little people go out and dance on
the green. The Irish stories are just enchanting.
They love the little people."</p>

<p>Her eyes had been following the dances and she
moved her head faintly as if she was keeping
time. Then the fiddles gave a sharp staccato and
stopped.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, in bewilderment.</p>

<p>He laughed at the startled look.</p>

<p>"They'll tune up and begin again." Oh, what
eager eyes she had. Why, she was really very pretty,
with that soft rose flush and fair hair. Olive had
called her "a plain little thing."</p>

<p>Sure enough that was long ago, remember, before
we heard of Strauss and Sousa. Many a quadrille
has begun with "Life let us cherish." Victor took her
hand and fairly impelled her out on the floor. "Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
I'll tell you everything, and you just mind and don't
feel afraid."</p>

<p>She never knew whether she minded or not. She
was thinking of Nora of the Mill when she stepped in
the magic ring, and Laudeen, with the blue coat and a
firefly for each button all the way down, just whisked
her around until the air was full of fireflies. It was
splendid.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've done very well," Victor said, in a delighted
tone. "You didn't mind the mistakes at all, but
just kept on, and that's the way to do. But you must
learn to dance regularly. And I hope we shall dance together
often. You are just like a fairy. That Larkin
girl trod on my foot about every other step. Oh, that
is the Cheat. That's rare fun. Now, see&mdash;when it
is 'All hands round,' and your partner turns the other
girls, come straight back to him, to <i>me</i>, will you?
The fellows left out get laughed at. Now, you'll see."</p>

<p>When the Cheat came he told her again. She turned
away from the outstretched arms and looked for Victor,
whose face was flushed. For he felt he had been
really rude to one of the best dancers in the room.
And in the next Cheat some one picked up Laverne,
almost lifting her off her feet, while Esta Collins paid
him back with interest and a triumphant smile.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it right," Laverne said ruefully. "He
was so big and strong, and I never saw him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a good deal of the fun when you know
all about it. The girls flirt awfully, but now and then
one gets left in the lurch. The next is the Spanish
Galop, and then the refreshments. Who is going to
take you in?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;" hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Then I will, and we will have this galop."</p>

<p>"Victor," Isabel said, rather sharply, in the pause.
"You take Miss Payne in for refreshments."</p>

<p>"Can't, my dear cousin. I wouldn't dare poach on
Leon Sturges' manor."</p>

<p>"Victor!" But he had gone.</p>

<p>"Just see how that little thing holds on to Victor!
Olive, you put a stop to it as soon as supper is over.
I didn't think Victor would make such a fool of himself.
He's danced three times with her. And she's
just crazy over it. She's making a sight of herself."</p>

<p>Olive nodded. She had had all the attention she
wanted, and had never once thought of Laverne, or
Victor either.</p>

<p>Victor was asking if Laverne didn't most blow away
up on the hill where she lived, and if she didn't get lost
in the dreadful fogs. And she told him about her
squirrel and the gull.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought they were the shyest, wildest
things, and that you couldn't touch them while they
were alive. And he really stays with you?" in amaze.</p>

<p>"He can't fly very far. You see, his wing isn't
quite right, though he can raise it, but it doesn't seem
strong. Still he flies so beautifully a short distance
it is a pleasure to see him. Sometimes I make believe
he is an albatross. And I tell him about the 'Ancient
Mariner.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you know that queer old thing! And do
you love verses? We're reading the Iliad at school.
It isn't verse exactly, but it's poetry all the same.
There are some splendid heroes in it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>She didn't know exactly what it was, but she liked
reading about heroes and her eyes kindled.</p>

<p>"Do you think I might come to visit you and the
gull? Are there any more pets?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a splendid big dog; and I never feel
afraid with him. And the loveliest Mexican pony.
Then the birds are very tame. There is the sauciest
mocking bird, and we whistle to each other. He will
come for crumbs, and when the weather is very dry
we put out a pan of water and it is fun to see them
bathe. And the jays chatter and scold so."</p>

<p>"How much you must love everything!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there are no children near by. Though
now I go to school."</p>

<p>"And you came from Maine, Aunt Grace said, all
the way round the Horn. Do you know they are talking
of a railroad across the Continent? Oh, what lots
of things we would have to talk about. I'll ask father
to let me come over here and then I'll come up and see
you&mdash;some Saturday."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be just delighted." The little face was
all rosy eagerness.</p>

<p>"You're not eating anything. Oh, here are the
mottoes. Now, we'll have some fun."</p>

<p>They were prizes to children in those days. A
candy in a pretty colored fringed paper, with two or
four printed rhymes, sometimes very funny, at others
sentimental. Victor had numbers sent to him by different
girls, who were beginning to think the little Maine
damsel was getting more than her share of him.</p>

<p>Olive stood ready to pounce upon him. But Miss
Holmes was there at the doorway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle Jason has come," she said, in a low
tone. "Are you not tired and almost ready to go
home?"</p>

<p>Laverne took the outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Remember," Victor said, "I shall come before
long."</p>

<p>"Really," began Olive tauntingly, "you seem very
fond of small fry."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;she is your friend. You have told us ever
so much about her. And she's a nice little thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, a mere child! A flower of the field sort of
thing," rather disdainfully.</p>

<p>He thought her very ungracious when she had been
quite eloquent over Laverne at Oaklands.</p>

<p>She leaned against Miss Holmes' shoulder and
talked of the dancing, while two or three men discussed
the prospect of a road across the continent. The
hardships of the overland journey were almost incredible.
Congress could hardly be roused on the subject.
Daniel Webster, broad statesman as he was,
opposed it with energy. The Great American Desert
was a formidable thing. And there were the Rocky
Mountains. The gold fields might give out&mdash;it was
not an agricultural region&mdash;how could manufactures
ever be established so remote from every centre!
Spain and Mexico had tried their hands. There was
enough to do nearer home.</p>

<p>The little girl listened with a curious interest. It
was a wonderful country to her. Maine had nothing
to compare with it. And though she began to feel
sleepy now that she was quiet, she winked her eyes
hard so as not to lose a word.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>"We must go," Miss Holmes said at length; so they
rose and wished their host good-night.</p>

<p>What a glorious night it was! There was no moon,
but the wide blue vault was studded so thick with
stars, great golden, twinkling globes, that seemed to
keep Christmas as truly as when they sang to the shepherds
on the plains of Judea. All the air was spicily
fragrant, for there was just enough fog over on the
ocean side to make a dew and distil sweetness. Some
of the newly whitewashed houses glistened like marble,
and the brick ones threw a weird kind of shade. There
were clumps of trees, and the little girl half suspected
Indians or wolves lurking behind them.</p>

<p>"Did you have a nice time, little one?" asked her
uncle, in a fond tone.</p>

<p>The cool, fresh, inspiriting air had wakened her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was splendid! And I danced. Don't you
think I might go to dancing school? All the children
do. Olive's cousin was so nice to me, and he wants
to come and see the gull. And he has a pony, too.
He is going to ride over some day. He's nicer than
Dick Folsom; that is&mdash;he is polite and gentle, and
has such a sweet voice. Oh, I liked him so much.
And there were so many pretty and finely dressed
girls&mdash;maybe it was because I didn't have any brother
or cousin that he was so good to me."</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey gave a soft little sigh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<br />
ETHICS AND ETIQUETTE</h2>

<p>It was midnight, and the bells rang out for 1854. The
streets were full of people. Banjos were being
strummed, accordions lent their music. Singers really
made bedlam, but above all you heard every little
while the refrain from a chorus of voices:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The days of old, the days of gold,</p>
<p>The days of forty-nine."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Was San Francisco getting old in its scarcely more
than childhood? For in August of that year, John W.
Geary, who had been the last alcalde of the town, was
elected its first mayor, and the city had her charter in
due American form. It had stretched up and down
the bay, the wharves were crowded with shipping.
Had ever any other city such a marvellous
story!</p>

<p>Yet in 1854, the world was still a little old-fashioned
and friendly. Never was there a more peerless day.
Over the hilltops came streams of brilliance with the
rising sun that drove the fog before it into the ocean.
The lowlands were alive with the slant rays that
wavered and wandered about like seas of gold.
Flowers seemed to have sprung up in the night.
Flags were flying. The streets were full of men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
boys; one would have thought it a grand procession.
For New Year's calls were then the great fashion.
The day was given over to the renewals of friendships.
Men put on their Sunday best, and went from
house to house with joyous greetings. And within
doors were groups of women to welcome them, and
rooms presented a gala aspect. Lovers found an opportunity
to say sweet things, friends clasped hands,
business was laid aside.</p>

<p>No doubt there were orgies here and there, quarrels
over cups, and fights, but even among the lower
ranks there was a great deal of jollity.</p>

<p>Then everybody went back to business. The great
Express Building was opened, having been more than
a year under way, and a big banquet given in the evening.</p>

<p>The weather underwent a sudden change. Ice froze
in the pools about the streets. Icicles hung from the
roofs of the houses and children thrashed them down,
and went about eating them like sticks of candy. There
was veritable snow on some of the hills, and those at
Contra Costa were white and glittering in the sun.
The old Californians, who were fond of lazing about in
the sun, and smoking a pipe, laid it to those Yankee
devils who had turned everything upside down. There
would be no more good times in "Californy." Even
the miners came in and grumbled. The rains in the
fall and winter had been slight, then a sort of freshet
had swollen the rivers, which were too full for "wet
diggings," as the hill sides had been too dry for "dry
diggings."</p>

<p>It seemed as if a series of misfortunes happened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The fine new clipper ship <i>San Francisco</i> missed her
bearings and struck on the rocks on the north side of
the channel. Some lives were lost, and a storm coming
up, scattered much of the cargo. Added to this was a
very general depression in business, but in all new cities
there are lean years as well as fat ones.</p>

<p>The little girl had said nothing more about dancing
school, although there was a very nice class that met
twice a week not far from the school. She and Olive
had a little "tiff," and now hardly spoke. She would
have liked to consult some one, but Miss Holmes and
Mrs. Personette were now very cordial friends, and
she was not sure that she had been exactly right herself.
She could not quite make up her mind to be
blamed. She had said to Uncle Jason that she had
changed her mind, she did not want to go to dancing
school just yet.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time for that," he responded
cheerfully. "And I guess dancing comes kind of natural
to little girls. You can put on the fancy touches
by and by."</p>

<p>Then he gave her such a hug that she knew he was
pleased with her decision, though down in the depths
of her heart she really would have liked it. Sometimes
she danced around out of doors, going through
whatever figures she could recall.</p>

<p>This was what had happened: She had spoken cordially
to Olive the first morning school had begun
again, and Olive had given her head a toss, and mumbled
something. Then at recess she had joined some
of the larger girls. The Personette girls went home
to luncheon; Laverne brought hers. There were several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
smaller children that she liked very much, and they had
a nice play together. Olive generally claimed her, but
for several days she took very little notice of her. She
had a feeling that Laverne would feel hurt and want
to know the reason. But the latter was too much
afraid of a rebuff to advert to it.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think it's queer that I'm acting this
way," Olive began, when her indifference seemed to
pass unnoticed. "But, really, you were so forward at
my party&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forward!" Laverne gasped. "Why, I&mdash;I was almost
frightened at first. I had never been to a real
party before."</p>

<p>"Well, you made yourself very conspicuous. Esta
Collins thought you bold enough."</p>

<p>Laverne's face was scarlet. "What did I do?" she
asked in a tremulous tone, trying to keep down a great
throb that wanted to rise in her throat.</p>

<p>"What did you do, Miss Innocence? Well, I declare!
You didn't dance three times with my cousin,
and then march in to supper with him, and talk and
laugh just as if you didn't mean to let him look at another
girl. And you had never met him before! It
was shameful!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;he asked me!"</p>

<p>The tears did come now. She tried very hard to
wink them away.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! But he never supposed you were going
to hang on him that way. And there were girls who
had known him long before, just waiting to be asked.
You see, as he was <i>my</i> cousin, he was&mdash;well, almost
like the host, and should have gone around. You're a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
regular flirt, Laverne Chadsey, and you will never get
asked to any party of mine again."</p>

<p>"You didn't ask me this time," said Laverne, with
spirit. "It was your mother. And it wasn't altogether
your party."</p>

<p>"Well, it was <i>my</i> cousin."</p>

<p>"She is Isabel's cousin also."</p>

<p>"Well, she did not like it, either."</p>

<p>Laverne wanted to say she was sorry. No one had
ever quarrelled with her before. But was she really at
fault? There came a sudden flash of spirit.</p>

<p>"It was mean in your cousin to ask me to dance so
many times when he knew it wasn't quite proper. He
was used to parties, I wasn't. I shall never want to go
to parties again; I just hate them."</p>

<p>With that Laverne turned away, holding her head
very high. She missed in one lesson that afternoon,
and asked Miss Bain if she might not stay in and go
over it; she knew it then, but she was confused by
something else. Her uncle was always so proud of
her marks that she did not want to disappoint him.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," returned Miss Bain smilingly. "I
wish all little girls were as careful."</p>

<p>She was rather grave at home that afternoon. She
told Bruno about it and he gave her a world of sympathy
out of large, loving eyes.</p>

<p>Then there were several smaller girls that she found
very companionable. One of them discovered a way
to walk together for some distance by making the circuit
just a little longer. Her mother was French and
had been born in New Orleans. There were five children;
she, Lucie, was the oldest. Her father was one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the old California residents, and had fought in the
war. Last summer they had gone down to Santa Cruz
and had a lovely time. She had only one little sister,
the baby. So they made quite a friendship.</p>

<p>After the cold snap it seemed as if spring had come
in earnest. Everything took to growing. Miss
Holmes and Laverne had delightful rides about on
Saturdays. And one morning the child watched a lad
coming up the somewhat crooked road. He waved his
hand&mdash;yes, he smiled, too. Why, it couldn't be Victor
Savedra!</p>

<p>But it was, though. Laverne hardly knew whether
to be glad or sorry. But she was glad down in the bottom
of her heart, and ran a few steps to meet him, then
paused in pure bashfulness.</p>

<p>"Are you glad to see me? Don't you remember that
I told you I would come? I was at uncle's a fortnight
ago and meant to beg Olive to come up with me, but
behold!" and he laughed.</p>

<p>It was such a gay, infectious sort of laugh, and he
slid down from his pony and threw the rein over his
neck, then took both of her hands, while she colored
scarlet, and her eyes had merry lights in them.</p>

<p>"I dragged it all out of Olive. Did you have much
of a fuss with her? Girls are so queer! It was because
I danced two or three times with you. Why, I
thought you were such a dainty little thing. I liked
you. Some of the girls are so&mdash;well, so sentimental&mdash;silly.
Olive has a temper, though. And now&mdash;<i>are</i> you
glad. Father knows your uncle a little. And he said I
might come over; father, I mean. I always tell him
where I go on Saturdays."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad," Laverne replied. "Oh, we were
going out to ride."</p>

<p>"We? Who?" and the bright young face fell a
little.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Holmes&mdash;who takes care of us."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's all right. Girls always do have
some one, you know. And I remember her. She is
Aunt Grace's friend."</p>

<p>"Yes, Pablo is bringing the horses." She led the
way with a springing step and smiled without knowing
just what made her happy.</p>

<p>"And the gull! Father thinks it really odd, that
you should tame him and he should want to stay."</p>

<p>"And he can fly quite well. Just a bit of the wing
droops down. Oh, here he is! We had such a time to
find a name for him. And once Uncle Jason was up
the coast of Norway and learned about the gods, and I
liked the story of Balder so much, Balder the beautiful,
and then I called him that. But Uncle Jason calls him
Jim."</p>

<p>"Did your uncle come for the Golden Fleece?"</p>

<p>"I think they find it here, if anywhere," she returned,
smiling. "Here, Balder," and she held out her
hand.</p>

<p>He was not exactly graceful in his walk. But he
came and put his head in his little mistress's hand.</p>

<p>She stroked his neck, "Pretty Balder," she said.
"Did Pablo get you some fish?"</p>

<p>Balder glanced rather suspiciously at the newcomer.
And just then Miss Holmes came down. After the
first glance she remembered the young fellow, who explained
a certain amount of curiosity had drawn him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
hither, and since they were ready for a ride he begged
to accompany them.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "why didn't you bring the girls and
we should have had quite a party."</p>

<p>"I am afraid if I had gone there first I should have
missed you, they would have had so many plans. And
this excursion has been in my mind some time. I
wanted to see these remarkable pets."</p>

<p>"Snippy seems quite busy in these days providing
for his family; I think, too, he is rather jealous of
Jim."</p>

<p>"There are some such cunning little squirrels, but
Snippy keeps them closely at home, down in the hollow
of the tree."</p>

<p>"If you would like to walk about a little&mdash;the rains
have given us quite a picturesque aspect, and the
weather has brought us into spring."</p>

<p>"Will Miss Laverne be my guide?"</p>

<p>"That sounds just like school. When you get in
the highest class, where your cousin Isabel is, you are
called Miss&mdash;whatever your last name happens to be.
I don't like it so well."</p>

<p>"But you will when you get to be a young
lady."</p>

<p>"I like girls the best," she said simply.</p>

<p>He thought they would be quite charming if they
all resembled her.</p>

<p>They took the winding path up to the spring, if it
were that; Pablo, under Uncle Jason's direction, had
made quite a basin of it. Then it trickled down to the
next level, and this was Balder's pool. It was arranged
so that it irrigated quite a little garden. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
some orange trees, but they had been nipped by the
frosts.</p>

<p>"They are rather bitter and sour and full of seeds,"
said Laverne, "only they are beautiful with their
glossy leaves, and the blossoms are sweet. Everything
is wonderful here."</p>

<p>"It truly is." He was glancing about. "Father
ought to see this. But you know we think Oaklands
the garden spot of all as you go on down the Bay.
It's much wilder going up, and here it doesn't seem a
bit promising, but you have made it so. I wonder what
about it charmed your uncle?"</p>

<p>She remembered the old home in Maine was rather
rocky and wild. She rarely thought of it now.</p>

<p>"Here is where Snippy lives. Though there are
plenty of squirrels about and rabbits and everything, it
seems to me. Snippy," she called, "Snippy."</p>

<p>A sharp nose and two bright eyes appeared above
the hollow and dropped down at once. "Snippy! Oh!
you needn't be afraid." She threw some bits of hardtack
down. Then there was a sudden gray flash, and
he was out on the ground, caught on her frock and
ran up to her shoulder. He looked saucily over to
Victor Savedra as if he questioned what business he
had there.</p>

<p>The boy laughed. "We have some fine birds, and
beautiful tame deer. I suppose I could tame a squirrel.
But the funny thing is that he should have decided to
move up here."</p>

<p>"We brought him first, you know. I didn't think
about his having any folks then. And there is getting
to be quite a colony of them. Uncle Jason will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
have them shot. Though Pablo shot a wildcat not
long ago. And the birds do not seem afraid any
more. I know where there are several quails' nests."</p>

<p>"I expect you understand bird language."</p>

<p>They turned to go down. Pablo had given Victor's
pony a drink. Miss Holmes stood patting her horse's
neck.</p>

<p>"I've done up a little lunch," she announced. "Are
you quite sure you have time to devote to our picnic?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I have a whole day to spend. And I am
delighted that you permit me to accompany you. I
hope you will come to Oaklands and allow me to be
the host."</p>

<p>They went down on the westerly path. Part of the
way it was a rather rough road, and they had the ocean
at their side. Here was a kind of depression in the
rocky barricade, and down by the shore a herd of deer
were sniffing the ocean breezes. How pretty and graceful
they looked, startled, too, as the wind wafted the
sound of voices to them. Then they suddenly vanished
as if the ocean had swallowed them up, and the three
looked at each other with surprised and laughing
eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes found young Savedra a very entertaining
companion. He expected presently to go to
England for his education. There was a rather delicate
girl next in age to him, who had not been strong
enough to come over to the Christmas party. Then a
rollicking hoyden, and last of all a second son. It was
evident he cared a great deal for his mother. His
sister had one of the nervous musical temperaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and was fond of solitude. The Personette girls were
very different, more like their father.</p>

<p>He was really entertaining for so young a person.
He knew many of the older stories of the country,
the Missions, the Indians, and the lower-class Mexicans.
They turned into quite a new road for them,
that seemed hidden away by an edge of woods, and
presently came to a charming spot where he tethered
the horses, and they ate their lunch. Little did they
dream that one day even this solitude would be invaded
by the resistless hand of improvement. Shy, wild
things were running about, birds sang in every sort of
key. Gulls swooped down for fish, a great cormorant
went sailing slowly along, and seals frolicked almost
like children.</p>

<p>"I suppose we could go across here and come up to
the eastward," Miss Holmes said. "This has been delightful.
We keep to the beaten paths when we are
alone, but on Sunday, with Mr. Chadsey, we make
farther ventures. We must bring him here, Laverne, if
we can remember the way."</p>

<p>"I'll make a diagram for you," he laughed. "I
might have 'blazed a trail,'&mdash;isn't that what you Yankees
call it? But there are so many beautiful roads.
And farther down everything is lovelier still. I suppose
the eastern world is quite different, with its long,
cold winters."</p>

<p>"But to the southward we have pleasant lands,
where there is not much winter, and where vegetation
is almost as wonderful as here, where roses bloom and
tropical fruit ripens. Oh, the Atlantic has many fine
points and great cities."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to see them. I hope some day to
travel round the whole world. Miss Laverne, don't
you want to go to India?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," and she made a little gesture of
aversion. "Uncle Jason has been to many of the seaport
towns. And he did not like the natives over well.
He thinks them indolent and cruel and all that. And
there are tigers and poisonous snakes&mdash;no, I do not
think I want to go."</p>

<p>"I should like to talk with your uncle. You know
we larger boys are studying up curious vestiges of the
old civilizations and races. There were people here
before the Indians, and it is supposed they came across
Behring Strait from Asia."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes wide.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought the Indians were the first race."</p>

<p>"They must have driven out some other people, or
driven them down to Mexico, perhaps. But I suppose
girls don't need to know all this;" and he laughed.
"Oh, look at this picture before we go."</p>

<p>The curve of the path down toward the rocky shore
made a striking perspective. There was no wind, but
the far-off waves had a golden crest that came nearer
and nearer, as if bearing the treasures of the Orient;
the air was full of spice and sweetness; wild grape,
fern, cedar, and pine, fluttering butterflies, almost like
small birds, made swift dazzles, or seemed to hang
poised in the still air as if considering which way to
take. The sea was marvellously blue, so was the sky
overhead, but round the edges where it touched the sea
there was a soft gray mistiness, here whitening, there
taking on an azure tint.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>He was mysteriously touched by beauty, though he
was a whole-hearted boy, and occasionally dipped into
fun of the unorthodox sort. Who could help it in such
a wild country?</p>

<p>Miss Holmes nodded, she, too, was deeply moved.
They turned about, the road was narrow and carpeted,
one might say, with countless wild roses, flaming lilies,
others as yellow as the palest sulphur color; little juniper
trees, with their pale green shoots that had never
yet seen sunshine; blackberry vines, that were in bloom
at least six months of the year, with their starry
crowns, and berries of all ripening colors. The horses
kicked them aside, they were meet food for the birds.</p>

<p>They came farther inland through tall woods, great
stretches of wild oats and barley, meadows that would
presently be brown with burnt roots of vanished things.
Here and there an adobe house, small children playing
about in cotton shirts, and shouting with the same
riotous glee that informed the bird's song.</p>

<p>Pelajo gave a whinny as they came in sight of the
house that looked as if set among the rocks. Bruno
rushed out. Balder gave a cry of welcome. They had
all missed the little girl, who talked to them in a language
they understood and loved.</p>

<p>"I hardly know how to thank you for such a delightful
day," Victor Savedra said, in his refined manner
that was hearty as well. "I had not thought of so
much pleasure when I came. And I do hope to return
it. You see, I haven't felt quite like a stranger, Aunt
Grace has talked of you so often. We all like her so
much. And at first we felt quite startled at the thought
of uncle marrying a Yankee woman," and he smiled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
with a sort of gay retrospection. "Yet, she had been
so good to the aunt that died. But it is largely in the
cultivation, don't you think? Many of those first Eastern
people were of good birth, and they were fine
pioneers, we can't deny that. And we shall plan for
you to come over on some Saturday with her and the
girls, for I want you to see mother."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes thanked him cordially, and the little
girl said the same thing with her eyes and her
smile.</p>

<p>Yet, after she had made the round of her pets, had a
splendid drink of water, and seen Pelajo munching his
wisps of alfalfa&mdash;Pablo would not give him too much
at a time&mdash;she came in and sat down in her favorite low
chair, while Miss Holmes was making some supper
preparations, beating-up an old-fashioned cake of which
Uncle Jason was very fond, and that suggested to him
the weekly bakings in the old ovens back in Maine.</p>

<p>The little girl was quiet so long that Miss Holmes
said presently: "Are you very tired?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I was thinking," and for an instant the
rosy lips were compressed. "Is it&mdash;do you think it
wrong to have secrets?"</p>

<p>Miss Holmes was alarmed and studied her anxiously.</p>

<p>"It depends on what they are, and with whom," she
answered gravely.</p>

<p>"Long ago, when we first knew her, Olive Personette
said girls always had secrets. They were
mostly about other girls. And I only knew the Estenegas,
and there wasn't anything about them except the
queer old house and Carmen going to a convent. She
didn't care about that. Then there was the party."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Olive was very angry because&mdash;because her cousin
was so nice to me."</p>

<p>Then the whole story came out, how Olive had
scarcely taken any notice of her, and had her seat
changed and played with the larger girls. But, after
awhile, it had blown over, and now they were good
friends again.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes had remarked an estrangement, but she
was not in love with Olive herself, and had made no
comment.</p>

<p>"I didn't want to tell Uncle Jason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," interrupted Miss Holmes quickly.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;I should have liked to know whether it was
quite right to dance so much with Victor, but you see
it was all done, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the whole, you were a very discreet little girl.
You did not know, of course. Olive should have been
more attentive to her guests. That wasn't a very
harmful secret, but I think your uncle would have been
quite vexed with Olive."</p>

<p>"I was afraid he would," she returned gravely.</p>

<p>"It is better to keep a secret than to stir up strife,"
Miss Holmes remarked.</p>

<p>"But now there's another secret," and a look of distress
clouded the fair face. "It's been such a lovely
day. I didn't ever suppose he would come without the
girls, but he has, and they do not know. Olive will be
angry, I am afraid."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes smiled inwardly, so as not to pain
Laverne. Even these little girls began to have troubles
and jealousies about the boys. She had been in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
it herself during childhood, she had seen a great deal of
it later on. And childhood should be such a sweet and
simple thing&mdash;a season of pure enjoyment.</p>

<p>"I think you had better say nothing about to-day.
I'll explain the matter sometime to Mrs. Personette."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be splendid! It was just a glorious
time, wasn't it? And I should be sorry to have it
spoiled."</p>

<p>Her face was joyous again with relief.</p>

<p>"But I can tell Uncle Jason?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>She would have felt much relieved if she had known
that the young fellow went straight to the Personettes
and found his aunt home alone. The girls were out
driving with some friends.</p>

<p>"Aunt Grace," he said frankly, after the first courtesies
had passed, "I've been up there on the hill where
the Chadseys live, getting acquainted with the pets; and
what an odd, pretty place it is. I like Miss Holmes very
much. I wish Isola had just such a friend instead of
that half-French governess. And Miss Laverne is a
very charming little child, isn't she? Can't you bring
them over some Saturday and I'll do my best to entertain
you. I've told mother a good deal about them&mdash;well,
so have you;" and he laughed with boyish
gayety.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been thinking of it. And now everything
is at its best. I'll be over in a day or two and we will
settle upon the time. I should like your mother to
know Miss Holmes. And, oh, what a treat it will be
for that little Laverne. She might almost as well be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
in a convent, but she is happy and bright as a lark.
She's a really charming child, but it would be a pity to
make an early 1800 girl out of her when we are passed
the middle of the century."</p>

<p>They both laughed at the idea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<br />
IN THE SUNSHINE OF YOUTH</h2>

<p>There was a great talk about hard times. Some discouraged
people returned east, convinced there was
just as good a chance for prosperity there. But the
city went on laying out streets, paving some, erecting
large business buildings, discarding old oil lamps, for
now gas was introduced. And in April, a branch Mint
was opened by the Government on Commercial Street,
which had been a great necessity, though there had been
allowed a private coining establishment. The payment
of many transactions had been in gold dust or nuggets.
There was also an earnest endeavor to awake interest
in a through railroad service. The overland route was
hazardous, painful, and expensive, that round the Horn
tedious, and across the isthmus difficult.</p>

<p>There were also several filibustering expeditions that
came to grief, and some quite noted citizens were tried
and punished. Riots, too, were of frequent occurrence,
but, on the whole, a spirit of improvement was visible
everywhere. The long-neglected Plaza was regraded,
a fence placed around it, a flagstaff raised, and it became
quite a favorite resort, the drive around it being
thronged by carriages on pleasant afternoons.</p>

<p>The Vigilance Committee had done good work and
rendered the city much safer. Manufactures were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
started. True, coal had to be brought from some
distance, and there was a great need of really skilled
labor.</p>

<p>The little party that had taken the "Hazard of new
fortunes" were prospering. Now and then Dick Folsom
had been seized with a mining fever that had required
all the ingenious arguments of his mother to
combat. Then, seeing an opportunity, and having good
backers in the Dawsons, she had opened a sort of
Home Hotel that at once became a great favorite on
account of its excellent bread and rolls, and now Dick
had business enough on his hands, though it did not
quench his longing for a more adventurous life.</p>

<p>Miss Gaines, too, had extended her borders. She
had taken a place on an attractive street and opened a
real business of dressmaking and millinery, and was
largely patronized, Boston being considered really
higher style than New York. Jacintha Vanegas had
married, and Miss Gaines had persuaded the mother to
sell her old house as the lot was needed for an important
improvement. So Señora Vanegas came to
keep house for her, and Felicia to be her right-hand
woman.</p>

<p>"It's worlds better than teaching school," she explained
to Miss Holmes. "When you once rise to a
positive dictum in style, people give in to you and pay
you any price. I'm not going to spend all my time on
furbelows. After a few years I shall retire and take
some journeys about the world. One of my cousins
is anxious to come out and I shall send for her. As for
marrying&mdash;I certainly shall not take a man to hang on
to me, as one might easily every month in the year."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>The hard times had touched Jason Chadsey rather
severely, but he held up his head bravely. For he saw
that San Francisco must be the brain of the outlying
country. The treaty with Japan would open up new
ventures. There was to be a line of mail steamers
from San Francisco to Shanghai. And all up and
down the coast from Puget Sound to the Isthmus vessels
were plying, bringing the treasures of other lands.</p>

<p>The visit to Oaklands had been beautifully arranged.
Mrs. Savedra had sent a written invitation to her sister-in-law,
enclosing a note to Miss Holmes. They were
to come early in the morning, at least the big carriage
would meet the boat at ten. It was across the bay, to
be sure, but only like a ferry.</p>

<p>Olive took upon herself the real significance of the
visit. They were <i>her</i> relatives, not even her stepmother's.
Her aunt was quite French still and talked
with a pretty accent, and was really very charming,
though she did not go much into society.</p>

<p>"Of course, you've seen Victor&mdash;you can't help
liking him, you know. Isola is only a year younger,
but she's a queer, fretful sort of girl, who always has a
headache if she doesn't want to do the things you
choose. Elena is a little witch, good and bad, sweet
and sour all in a minute. Then some children died,
and Andrea is a sweet, big, spoiled baby."</p>

<p>Laverne laughed.</p>

<p>"If Isola was like most girls we could have lots of
fun. I hate half-sick people, don't you? I want them
to be ill enough to stay in bed, or else able to have some
fun. She plays beautifully on the organ, though, and
the piano."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I do love music," declared Laverne. "I could
listen forever."</p>

<p>"Then you and she will get along. Victor will entertain
Isabel, of course. You can't have him all the
time," with a touch of malice.</p>

<p>Laverne turned scarlet.</p>

<p>Up and down the bay seemed alive with vessels of
every kind and degree, and some sailboats keeping
out of the way of the larger craft.</p>

<p>Victor had the big family carriage with its three
seats.</p>

<p>"I'm going to sit with the driver," announced Olive.</p>

<p>Victor assisted the ladies in, expressing his pleasure
that it was a fine day and that they could all come.
The two handsome horses flung up their heads and
pawed the ground a little. They went somewhat south-easterly,
passed the streets that already had quite a
city aspect, and then turned into a road bordered with
magnificent trees and almost paved with great violets
of all colors, and farther back a wild profusion of
bloom. Geraniums like small trees, brilliant in scarlet,
rose, and pink. Magnificent palms, shining olive trees,
and oranges that had been cultivated to perfection.
Laverne drew long breaths of the perfumed air.</p>

<p>All at the southern side was an immense garden.
At the north it was protected by a great belt of woods.
How different from their rocky mound, but she recalled
the fact that Victor had found some points to admire.</p>

<p>The mansion was broad and low, the centre reaching
up two stories with a sharp peak, the wings but one
story. A porch ran the whole length of it, shaded by
heliotrope trained as a vine and full of purple bloom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
and passion flowers in lavender, purplish red and white,
with touches of grayish purple. These climbed over
lattices, leaving spaces between that looked like French
windows reaching to the ground. It was really a succession
of rooms. Easy chairs, lounging chairs (one
on wheels for Isola when she felt indisposed for walking),
small tables with books and papers, or a work-basket,
and down one end a large one with various
dishes of fruit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savedra welcomed them in a most cordial manner.
She was hardly medium height; indeed, she
looked short beside these taller women. Her black
hair was a bed of ripples with curling ends, her eyes a
soft dusky black, and her complexion a rather pale sort
of olive with a dash of color in the cheeks.</p>

<p>Victor could hardly be said to resemble her, and yet
he had taken some of her best points.</p>

<p>Isola stood beside her mother, almost as tall, but slim
as a willow wand, and sallow as to complexion, with a
deep shade under the eyes. Her hair was a duller tint,
and her eyes a gleam that in some lights would have a
suggestion of yellow.</p>

<p>There were also two young gentlemen&mdash;one a visitor
who had come with his father on some business, the
other a schoolmate of Victor's that the Personette girls
had met before, Vance Lensam. Louis Alvarado was
older than either of them, a handsome young fellow,
with blue black hair and eyes that seemed to look
through one.</p>

<p>Victor had asked his friend Vance, so that, he said
laughingly, his cousins would not pull him to
pieces.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>"And this is the little girl we have heard about, who
took the long, long journey around Cape Horn," Mrs.
Savedra said, holding her small fair hand and glancing
smilingly into the deep blue eyes. "I took one journey
from New Orleans with my husband, and it seemed
endless, though we had many pleasures by the way and
some dangers. Once we lost our way and had to sleep
in the woods, and we heard the wolves howl."</p>

<p>"There were no wolves on shipboard and we
couldn't get lost," returned the child, in a soft tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, you might have been blown out of your course
by a storm," commented Victor.</p>

<p>"I think we were once or twice. But they all said
it was an exceptional passage," returned his aunt.</p>

<p>Then they were seated on the porch while the maids
took their hats and mantles, for one never quite knew
when a strong west wind would come up. And for a
few moments there was a confusion of pleasant voices.
The servant brought a great stone pitcher of delightful
fruit beverage and filled the glasses. It was ice-cold
and most grateful. There were some queer crispy
cakes with scalloped edges that were very nice, Laverne
thought.</p>

<p>The elders began to talk on the subjects of the day.
There was never any lack of news in the various
papers, though there were few telegraph connections
and no cables to flash around the world. Vance Lensam
came round to Isabel's side. He had been to the
theatre a few nights before and seen a remarkable
young actress, Miss Heron, in the play of "Fazio," and
it was superb.</p>

<p>"I want so to go to the theatre," declared Isabel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
"Father will not allow us, he declares it is no place for
young people."</p>

<p>"Anybody might see this play, I think. And the
audiences have grown more respectful and respectable.
We are getting to be quite a staid and orderly city,"
and he laughed with a little irony.</p>

<p>"And just as soon as a girl is married she can go
anywhere," Isabel declared.</p>

<p>"With her husband&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"And I want to go to a real ball. I have outgrown
children's parties. Oh, there are to be some splendid
picnics when school closes. I hope we can go. Mother
has so many engagements all the time. We ought to
have a summer governess."</p>

<p>"That would be a good idea. One as manageable as
the Señorita's," and he half nodded in Isola's direction.</p>

<p>"But she never wants to do anything worth while.
Oh, dear, it isn't a nice thing never to be real well."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>"Do you know that Mr. Alvarado?"</p>

<p>"I only met him yesterday. They are Spanish
Cubans, I believe."</p>

<p>"Come down and talk to him. Oh, I do get on so
slowly with French and Spanish. Mother wishes she
could send me to a good Eastern school, where they
make girls study."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it?" enquiringly.</p>

<p>"Do they lock them up and keep them on bread and
water, or beat them? I'd like to see the teacher who
could make me study."</p>

<p>"Are you so very obstreperous?" he laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't see the use of so much of it. You marry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
and that's the end of learning. But I wish I was a
good French scholar. I was quite ashamed the other
night. Father had a French visitor come in about
something, and he didn't understand English very well,
so he asked me to translate, and I couldn't."</p>

<p>"Moral!" Vance said sententiously.</p>

<p>They had been moving slowly down to the young
man, who now gave them a nod of welcome, and began
to air his rather lame English.</p>

<p>The nurse brought out the baby, a charming child of
four, and Laverne's face lighted up with joy.</p>

<p>"You are fond of babies," said the mother, in a glad
tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and there are so few of them, except the
dirty street children."</p>

<p>"Where is Lena?" asked Olive.</p>

<p>"One can never tell for five minutes where she is,"
said the mother.</p>

<p>"I'm going to hunt her up; she's such fun."</p>

<p>But Olive went no further than the group shaded
by the passion vine, and the four were in the midst of
something amusing, to judge by their merry laughs.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't know Alvarado could be so gay,"
declared Victor. "He doesn't talk very well, and last
night I hardly knew how to entertain him. His father
is to send him North to one of the cities in the
autumn. We need some of this work here, high
schools and colleges."</p>

<p>"That will come. Think how young you are. I
am amazed at the progress," declared Mrs. Personette.</p>

<p>"I suppose San Francisco is an old, young city.
The Americanos have really overpowered us. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Aunt Grace, did you ever stand in the street a few
moments and listen to the jargon? You can imagine
what the Tower of Babel must have been. I think we
have gathered all the nations of the earth within our
borders. And the Chinese are the oddest. Oh,
mother, I am glad you were not a Chinese woman."</p>

<p>"I think your father would not have been allowed to
marry me," she said smilingly. "And I did not know
a word of English then. I had been in a convent. We
thought it a barbarous tongue."</p>

<p>"It's going to conquer the world some day."</p>

<p>"Will everybody speak English, do you think?" and
Laverne glanced up. The baby's arms were tight
about her neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, baby!" cried the mother. "Nurse, you had
better take him."</p>

<p>It was funny to hear the baby scold in French.</p>

<p>"Victor, you might take the little girl&mdash;Laverne, is
it not? and show her the garden. I heard about your
pets. You must have a charm."</p>

<p>Laverne smiled. They walked down the porch and
Victor paused a moment to invite his friends to join
them. They did not at once, but the two kept on.
They turned down a wide alley, under some orange
trees. The late blossoms had fruited, the early ones
been killed by the unusual frost of the winter.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is so beautiful, so very beautiful!" she
exclaimed, with almost the poignancy of joy. "I never
supposed there was all this beauty such a little distance
from us. Why didn't they come over here and build
the city?"</p>

<p>"You will not ask that twenty years from this time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
San Francisco will be one of the great cities of the
world, the gateway of the Western coast, the link of
everything splendid! Think of the Golden Gate, of
the magnificent bay, where no enemy could touch a
ship. And that rocky coast, a defence in itself."</p>

<p>"Twenty years," she repeated musingly. "Why, I
shall be quite an old woman," and a look almost of
terror flashed up in her face.</p>

<p>He laughed at her dismay. "I am not quite seventeen.
Then I shall be thirty-seven, and I hope to have
a home and be just as happy as my father is, and shall
endeavor to be just as prosperous. But I wouldn't
want you to call me an old man."</p>

<p>She flushed under his eager eyes.</p>

<p>"Everything grows finer here than in San Francisco.
Even at the Estenegas it was not luxuriant like
this."</p>

<p>"For fifteen years father has had it cultivated.
There are two gardeners working all the time. He
is so fond of beautiful things&mdash;trees, and flowers, and
birds. No one is allowed to molest them. Oh, listen!"</p>

<p>They both stood still. She clasped her hands, and
her eyes were lucent with mistiness.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "it is like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"'How they seemed to fill the sea and air,</p>
<p>With their sweet jargoning.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>Certainly they were a gay and happy lot, singing for
the very love of melody, it seemed. Then they passed
masses of flowers, beautiful groups of trees again,
wound around unexpected corners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder you found anything to praise up there on
the hill," she said in a low, rather disheartened tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I came to see you, and the gull, and Snippy,
and to have the nice ride. And I did have a fine day.
Now, you are not going to envy your neighbor's
garden!"</p>

<p>"Why, no; I wouldn't want to take it away if I
could, for there are so many of you to enjoy it, you
see, and only so few of us."</p>

<p>"And your uncle will be rich enough to give you
everything you want some day."</p>

<p>She had never thought about his being that.</p>

<p>A sudden shower of olives dropped down upon them
like a great pelting rain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elena, where are you, you little witch! Ah,
I see you. Shall I shake you down out of the tree?"</p>

<p>A gay, rippling laugh mocked him.</p>

<p>"Lena, come down. The little girl is here who has
the squirrel named Snippy, and the gull."</p>

<p>"I thought it was Olive. I was going to crown her
with her namesakes. Why did they give her that
name, like hard, bitter fruit?"</p>

<p>"Why are girls named Rose and Lily?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are pretty names, and sweet."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, no one consulted me about it.
Please, come down."</p>

<p>She laughed again, like the shivering of glass that
made a hundred echoes. Then there was a rustling
among the branches, and a lithe figure stood before
them, looking as if she might fly the next moment.</p>

<p>"Lena! Lena!" and Victor caught her by the
shoulder. "What did you promise this very morning&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
you wouldn't torment Olive, but behave
discreetly."</p>

<p>"This isn't Olive," and she gave her elfin laugh.</p>

<p>"But you meant it for Olive. This is the little girl
who lives over on the rock, where we go to see the seals
and the great flocks of birds. You know I told you of
her."</p>

<p>Elena stared at the visitor. She had a curious,
gypsy-like brilliance, with her shining, laughing mischievous
eyes and the glow in her cheeks. She was
very dark, a good deal from living in the sun, and not
a bad-looking child either. And now an odd, coquettish
smile flashed over the eyes, mouth, and chin, and was
fascinating in its softness. She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Victor likes you so much," she said, and Victor
flushed at the betrayal of confidence he had used to
persuade her into cordiality. "I think I shall like you,
too. Let us run a race. If I beat you, you must like
me the most and do just as I say, and if you beat
I will be just like your slave all day long."</p>

<p>"No, Lena. You must not do any such thing."</p>

<p>"She is like a little snail then! She is afraid!" and
the black eyes flashed mirth as well as insolence.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid." Laverne stood up very straight,
a bright red rose blooming on each cheek. "Where
to?" she asked briefly.</p>

<p>"Down to the fig trees."</p>

<p>"Will you count three?" Laverne asked of Victor.</p>

<p>He smiled and frowned.</p>

<p>"Count!" she insisted authoritatively.</p>

<p>They started like a flash, the shadows dancing on the
path. Elena gained. Victor grew angry, and came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
after them; then Laverne gave a sudden swift swirl
and turned on her antagonist.</p>

<p>Lena stopped with a laugh. She was not angry.</p>

<p>"How you can run!" she exclaimed. "I wish you
lived here. We would have races twenty times a day.
And&mdash;can you climb trees?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"And swim?"</p>

<p>"No," admitted Laverne frankly.</p>

<p>"Then you can't do everything that I can."</p>

<p>"And she can do something you cannot. She can
read French and Spanish, while you really can't read
English; she can do sums and write letters, and&mdash;and
sew," he was guessing at accomplishments now.</p>

<p>"There are the women to sew."</p>

<p>"But you might be wrecked on an island where
there were no women, and tear your frocks, as you generally
do."</p>

<p>Laverne smiled. How find a needle and thread on
a desolate island? Lena did not see the point, and
looked rather nonplussed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I shouldn't care then," she retorted.</p>

<p>"Come, let us go to the aviary. Miss Laverne will
like to see the birds."</p>

<p>There was a large space netted in from tree to tree
in which there were many rare birds of most exquisite
plumage, and quantities of tiny South American love
birds, gossiping with each other in low, melodious
tones.</p>

<p>"Oh, how wonderful!" Laverne exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It's a great fancy of father's. Sea captains bring
him birds from all countries. After a while, when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
get really acclimated and can protect themselves, he lets
them out to settle in the woods about. Do you see
those two with the beautiful long tails? They came
from the island of Java. Do you know where that is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it is one of the Sunda Islands down by the
Indian Ocean. Uncle Jason has been to Borneo and
Sumatra. And coffee comes from Java."</p>

<p>"How do you know? Have you been there?" questioned
Elena.</p>

<p>"Father knows, and he has not been there," returned
Victor. "He could tell you a good many things if you
did not like to learn them out of books."</p>

<p>Laverne walked round the inclosure in a trance of
delight. And though the voices now and then made
discord, on the whole it was a fascinating orchestra.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you tame some of them?"</p>

<p>"It would take a long time, I think. Those bright
Brazilian birds are very wild. Every one cannot
charm birds, and father is a pretty busy man."</p>

<p>Elena soon tired of the birds, and inquired if Laverne
had a pony. Then they might ride after
luncheon.</p>

<p>"And it must be nearly that now. Come, let us go
up to the house."</p>

<p>Elena chattered like a magpie, and danced about, now
and then hopping on one foot, and running to and fro.</p>

<p>"You will think we are a rather queer lot," Victor
said, half in apology.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>you</i> are not queer. I like you very much."
She raised her clear, innocent eyes, and it seemed a
very sweet compliment to him.</p>

<p>"There isn't much training. Mamacita could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
govern a cat, though, for that matter, I don't believe
cats are easily governed. Cats are queer things. But
school straightens up one, I suppose. Elena will go to
a convent to be trained presently. Isola cannot, so she
has a governess to teach her music and a few things.
You must hear her play on the organ. All she cares
about is music."</p>

<p>"Is she very ill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not very, I think. But she won't ride, which
the doctor thinks would be good for her, and she goes
about in that wheeling chair when she ought to walk,
and lies in the hammock. Mamacita would like her to
be gay and bright and entertaining to the young men,
as Isabel is, because all girls are expected to marry.
Mamacita was only fifteen when papa met her at a
ball at New Orleans. That must be a very gay place,
without the crime and rough life that San Francisco
has. I do hope sometime we will be civilized, and not
have to take in the off-scourings of all lands. I want
it to be a splendid city, like Rome on its seven hills.
And there is the grand sea outlook that Rome did not
have, though she made herself mistress of the seas."</p>

<p>The little girl watched him with such intelligent
eyes that it was a great satisfaction to talk to her.
She was different from any one he had known. For
those of the Southern blood were coquettes from their
very cradle, and wanted to talk of pleasure only. Of
course, she was being brought up by a great traveller,
even if he had never risen higher than mate of a trading
vessel. And then the eastern women were somehow
different.</p>

<p>Elena ran on, and announced with a shout "that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
were coming." The porch was set out with little tables.
Mrs. Personette was the matron of the one that had
her daughters and the two young men. Mrs. Savedra
took charge of Elena and Isola, and left Miss Holmes
to Laverne and Victor.</p>

<p>There were flowers and fruits, dainty summer viands,
and much gay chatting, since they were near enough
to interchange with each other. Laverne was very enthusiastic
about the aviary.</p>

<p>"Oh, you must go out and see it," she said eagerly.</p>

<p>Victor was thinking of the great difference between
Miss Holmes and Mam'selle Claire. Of course, she
could talk about musicians, she seemed to have them
at her tongue's end, and some French writers. He
was not of an age to appreciate them; young, energetic
souls were quoting Carlyle, even Emerson had crept
out here on the Western coast. In a way there was a
good deal of politics talked, and a rather bitter feeling
against the East for turning so much of the cold
shoulder to them. Even the suggestion of war with
England over the northern boundary did not seem very
stirring to these people. It was their own advancement,
the appreciation of all they held in their hands,
the wonderful possibilities of the Oriental trade. And
though it seemed quite necessary to study French, when
there were so many French citizens, the young fellow
considered the literature rather effeminate. But Miss
Holmes was conversant with the march of the Carthaginian
general over the Alps, and later, that of Napoleon,
and the newer scheme that had set their wisdom
at naught, and that the railroad was a necessity if the
Union was not to part in the middle. He liked Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Holmes' admiration of California. Mam'selle Claire
thought it rude and rough.</p>

<p>There was lounging in the hammocks afterward, the
sun was too hot to drive about. Isola went in the
room presently, and played some soft, low chords on
the organ. Laverne crept in, enchanted. She liked the
voluntaries in church when they had no grand crushes
in them. Victor was talking with Miss Holmes, so
she slipped away, for Elena had found the quiet irksome,
and there were always dogs to play with. The
dogs she thought better company than most people.</p>

<p>Laverne had never been near an organ. This was
not a very large one, but sweet-toned for parlor use.
She crept nearer and nearer, and almost held her
breath, while the tears came to her eyes. It seemed
the sad story of some one, the story the ocean waves
told at times, or the wind in the trees, when twilight
was falling, and now it was darkness, and you could
almost hear the stars pricking through the blue. Then
one faint call of a bird, and a far-off answer, and
lower, lower, until the sound wandered away and was
lost.</p>

<p>"Oh," she breathed, "oh!"</p>

<p>"You like it?"</p>

<p>Laverne drew a long breath. "Oh, that isn't the
word," she said. "We may like a good many things,
but they do not all go to your heart."</p>

<p>Isola took the fair face in both hands, which were
cold, but the child did not shrink, she was still so impressed
with the melody.</p>

<p>"Let me look at you. Oh, what beautiful eyes you
have&mdash;sometimes you find that color in the sky. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
music goes to the soul, the brain, and I wish I could
see yours. Did you feel as if you could swoon away?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to cry," Laverne said, in a tremulous
tone. "But it was not from sorrow nor joy; you sometimes
do cry when you are full of delight, but&mdash;at
times when I hear the right music in church, I think
that is what heaven will be like."</p>

<p>"What was that like&mdash;not heaven?"</p>

<p>"It was night when I am sitting out on the step, and
not thinking, but just watching the stars come out."</p>

<p>"Oh, you little darling. I wish you could stay here
always. I wish they, your people, would fancy Elena,
and we could change. She laughs, and it goes through
me like a bolt of lightning, and leaves me numb. I'd
like to have some one who listens that way. Mam'selle
declares the playing is wrong because I do not follow
the notes, and one day when she insisted, I flung myself
down on the floor and cried until I was sick. And
now I am let to play what I like most of the time. I
hate books&mdash;do you like to study dry, prosy things?
What does it matter whether the world is round or
square?"</p>

<p>"Why, it might not revolve in quite the right way,
and I guess the ships couldn't sail as well." She smiled
at the thought of the corners.</p>

<p>"Now, we will have morning."</p>

<p>First it was a wind rustling among the trees. The
sort of metallic swish of the evergreens, the whisper
of the pines, the patter of the oaks; then a bird singing
somewhere, another answering, hardly awake; young
ones peeping a hungry cry, then a gay, swinging, dashing
chorus, with a merry lark going higher and higher,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
until he was out of hearing. Sounds growing discordant,
impatient, harsh.</p>

<p>"That's the world," she explained; "morning down
on the bay; the people working, scolding, swearing;
don't you hate all that?"</p>

<p>"We are not near enough to hear it."</p>

<p>"But if you have heard it once you can imagine it.
And some music isn't much better. Mam'selle plays
things that set my teeth on edge. Do you know what
your soul is?"</p>

<p>Laverne was startled. "Why," hesitatingly, "it is
the part that goes to heaven."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;heaven must be sweet and soft and fair, if
it is full of angels. And why don't we keep to the
soft and lovely sides of everything if we are to go
there. Is kneeling on a hard stone floor in a convent at
all like heaven?"</p>

<p>"I should think not."</p>

<p>"Mam'selle considers it useful discipline. Why, it is
being dead to be shut up in a cold, dark cell. And I
think you are taken up in strong, tender arms, and
wafted above the clouds, like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she began to play again. The sound stole
along softly, halting a little, murmuring, comforting,
entreating, floating on and on to sounds so sweet that
the tears did overflow Laverne's eyes, and yet she was
not crying.</p>

<p>Victor glanced through the wide doorway.</p>

<p>"Why, that child has even found a way to Isola's
heart," he said.</p>

<p>"I have been listening. Your sister is really a
musical genius," Miss Holmes replied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<br />
NEW EXPERIENCES</h2>

<p>Mr. Savedra came home early to have a share in the
guests. It was pleasant now for riding and driving,
for the wind was coming from the ocean, and wafting
with it the inspiration that started the pulses afresh.
There were ponies and saddle horses. Laverne must
ride.</p>

<p>"I will go if she can sit by me in the carriage," said
Isola.</p>

<p>Laverne gave a quick breath. She would rather
have had the mount, but the almost melancholy eyes
decided her. She held out her hand with a smile, and
she saw that it pleased Mr. Savedra also.</p>

<p>Victor had a little of his mother, but he had taken
most of his good looks from his father.</p>

<p>"Aunt Grace, won't you go with them?" he said
persuasively. "I want Miss Holmes. Both of us
will be needed to keep watch of this monkey."</p>

<p>"As if I didn't go alone often and often!" Elena
retorted, wrinkling up her face in a funny fashion.</p>

<p>They took their way to the eastward, and were soon
in the open country, with the great Sierra Range
towering in the distance. Summer had not scorched
up the fields or the woods. Hill and valley were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
spread out before them, here glowing with flowers,
there still green with herbage, where Mexican shepherds
were letting their flocks browse. Some pastures
had been eaten off to the roots and glinted in golden
bronze. Tangles of wild grapes, with their pungent
fragrance, reaching up and climbing over clumps of
trees. The far-off points seemed to touch the very sky
that was like a great sea with drifts one could imagine
were an array of ships bound to some wondrous port.
Laverne thought of the weird experiences of the
"Ancient Mariner."</p>

<p>Yellow wings, blues of every shade, black and gold
and iridescent, dashed here and there or floated lazily
as if the butterfly had no body.</p>

<p>Isola held the child's hand, but did not say anything,
she hated exclamations. Mrs. Savedra smiled to herself,
she knew her daughter was enjoying her companion.
Laverne felt half mesmerized by the hand
that had been cold at first, and was now gently throbbing
with some human warmth. She seemed to have
gone into a strange country.</p>

<p>The sun set gorgeously as they were returning.
There was a tempting supper spread for them, and
some lanterns were lighted at the edge of the porch.
Then Mr. Savedra insisted upon sending the party
home in the carriage.</p>

<p>"I hope you have had a nice time, Laverne," Mrs.
Personette said, in a most cordial tone. "I don't know
what the Savedras will do with that daughter. I'd like
to shake her up out of that dreaminess. She'll be in
a consumption next. As for you two girls, I think you
have had your fill of attention to-day," and she laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
"You have a stepmother out of a thousand, and I hope
you will never do her any discredit."</p>

<p>They certainly had enjoyed their day wonderfully,
never imagining Victor had planned it so that he could
be left at liberty.</p>

<p>The little girl sat out under the rose vine that trailed
over their little porch, thinking of the beautiful house,
the garden, the grounds, the birds, and, oh, the organ
with its bewildering music.</p>

<p>"An organ must cost a good deal," she said, in a
grave tone, but there was no longing in it. "And then
if you couldn't play&mdash;I like the things that are not tunes,
that just go on when you don't know what is coming
next, and the voices of the birds and the sound of the
waves and all sweet things. It was like fairyland,
only I don't believe fairyland could be quite so
satisfying, and this is all real and won't vanish
when you wake up." She laughed tenderly in her
joy. "Mr. Savedra must be very rich," she continued.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," said Uncle Jason.</p>

<p>She leaned her head down on the broad breast where
the heart beat for her alone.</p>

<p>"And you had a happy day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, so happy. If you had been there!"</p>

<p>She should have all these things some day. He was
working and saving for her. And times had changed
very much. He and her mother could have been
happy in a little cottage where the sharp north winds
rushed down, and the drifts of snow hedged one in
half the winter. She busy about household work, he
wresting scanty crops from the grudging earth. Yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
if she could have seen a world like this! Well, the
little one should have it all, and see strange lands and
no end of beautiful things, for the world kept improving
all the time.</p>

<p>He began to feel a good deal more secure about her.
At first, when he saw men from every State in the
Union, men who had committed various crimes, tramps,
and scamps, he had a vague fear that somewhere
among them David Westbury would come to light.
He would not know him, only the name. And he
wished now he had changed his in this new western
world. But he would know nothing about the child
unless he went to the old home, and that was hardly
likely. But if some day, stepping off a vessel or wandering
around the docks, a man should clap him on
the shoulder and say, "Hello, Chadsey, old man, I
never thought to find you here!" he would shake him
off, or pay his way somewhere else.</p>

<p>It had never happened, and was not likely to now.
He could go on planning this delightful life for the
little girl. Presently they would make another move,
have a better house and finer furniture. He had lost
nothing through this snap of hard times, neither
had he made, but business looked brighter. Occasionally
he had a longing to go to the mines. Several
times he had dreamed of finding a great nugget, and
once he dreamed that in stumbling over rocks and
wilds, he had lost her. Night came on and all through
the darkness he called and called, and woke with great
drops of cold perspiration streaming down his brow.
No, he could not go to the gold fields and leave her behind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>The weeks and months passed on. There was vacation
when she went over to Oaklands, and had splendid
times again, and was fascinated by Isola and her music,
and they took up a peculiar friendship that seemed to
rouse the dreamy girl and delight Mrs. Savedra. Then
Mrs. Personette was going down to Monterey with her
two girls for a fortnight, and nothing would do but
Miss Holmes and Laverne should accompany them.
It was not the Monterey of forty years later, but a
queer old Spanish town with its convent, where they
found Carmencita Estenega, who did not look like a
joyous, happy girl, though next year she was to be
married.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Personette; "it seems
the same thing everywhere, just lovers and marriage.
There is really no career for girls here but that, and the
convent people are as anxious to marry them off as
any one else. To be sure, they can become sisters,
which covers the obloquy of old maidism. And so
many of the husbands are not worth having, and desert
their wives on the slightest pretext. I'd counted on
taking some comfort with my girls, but here is Isabel
considering every young man as a matrimonial subject,
wanting to leave school and go into society, and
her father saying, 'Why not?'"</p>

<p>Miss Holmes smiled a little.</p>

<p>"We used to think a girl ought to look at marriage
in a serious light, and get ready for the important
step; now it is fine clothes, an engagement ring, and a
wedding gown. But I suppose in this wonderful land
where your fruit buds, and blossoms, and ripens in a
night, girls do mature sooner."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>Some weeks later she saw her friend again and announced
that she had been compelled to yield.</p>

<p>"Isabel would not go to school," she said. "If
there had been a good boarding school anywhere near,
I should have pleaded hard for that. But her father
would not listen to her being sent East. She has a
smattering of several branches. She can converse quite
fluently in French and Spanish, she dances with grace
and elegance, she has correct ideas of the fitness of
things that are certainly attractive, and is quick at repartee.
She reads the fashion magazines when they
arrive, and the newspaper bits of arranging a table,
cooking odd dishes, giving luncheons and dinners.
She is really a fashionable young lady. And we are
to give a ball for her, and after that I must see that
she is properly chaperoned. My dear Marian, we <i>do</i>
belong to the past generation, there is no denying it.
And I half envy you that you can live out of the hurly-burly."</p>

<p>"I am glad myself," Miss Holmes returned. "So
far as most things go, we could be living in some quaint
old Puritan town. I don't know whether it is really
best for the child, but it suits her uncle to have it so.
Now she is going over to the Savedras two afternoons
a week to study piano music. They think Isola improves
by the companionship. And those French
children, the Verriers, are very nice and trusty. They
are up here quite often. She likes some of her schoolmates
very well, and she and Olive have friendly
spells," laughing.</p>

<p>"Olive blows hot and cold. She takes up a girl
with a certain vehement preference and for a while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
can think of no one else. Then she finds her friend
has some faults, or fails in two or three points, and she
is on with a new admiration. Girls are crude, funny
creatures! Do you suppose we were like them?" she
questioned with laughing, disavowing eyes.</p>

<p>"No, we were not," returned Marian. "Times have
changed. Life and its demands have changed. We
were taught to sew, to darn, to do fine needlework;
here a Mexican or a Spanish woman will do the most
exquisite work for a trifle. Every country lays its
treasures at our feet; it would be folly to spin and to
weave. And there is money to buy everything with.
How careful we were of a bit of lace that our grandmother
had! The women of the street flaunt in yards
and yards of it, handsomer than we could ever have
achieved. We are on the other side of the country, and
are topsy-turvy. We have begun at the big end of
everything. Whether we are to come out at the little
end&mdash;&mdash;" and she paused, her eyes indecisive in their
expression.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go back?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see dear old, proper Boston, and really
feel how much we had changed. But the breadth and
freedom here are fascinating. It has not the hardships
of new settlers. Even the men who sleep out on the
foothills with the blue sky for covering may be rich
six months hence, and putting up fine buildings. And
when you come to that there is no lack of intelligence.
Haven't we some of the best brain and blood of the
East, as well as some of the worst? Our papers are
teeming with news, with plans, with business schemes,
that would craze an Eastern man. No, I do not believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
I should be satisfied to take up the old life there
again."</p>

<p>"And now I must consider my daughter's entrée
into society. Think of the mothers in the old novels,
who took their daughters to Bath or to London, and
looked over the list of eligibles and made two or three
selections. Our young women will select for themselves
in a half-mercenary fashion, and one can't altogether
blame them. Poverty is not an attractive subject."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes was out for a little shopping expedition,
and went in her friend's carriage. Every year
saw great changes. Fire destroyed only to have something
grander rise from the ashes. There was already
an imposing line of stores, and a display of fabrics
that roused envy and heart-burning. Where there had
been one-story shanties filled with the miscellany of a
country store, only a few years ago, now all things
were systematized and compared well with some Eastern
towns, not as much, but certainly as great a variety.
It had taken San Francisco only a few years to grow
up. She sprang from childhood to full stature.</p>

<p>Then one drove round the Plaza to Russ's, mingling
in the gay cavalcade until a stranger might have considered
it a gala day of some sort. Then to Winn's
for luncheon, tickets, perhaps, to the theatre where
Laura Keene was drawing full houses of better-class
people.</p>

<p>The little girl was not in much of this. She went to
school regularly; she found some very congenial
friends. She never could tell how much she liked
Olive, and she was accustomed to be taken up with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
fervor and then dropped with a suddenness that might
have dislocated most regards, and would if she had
set her heart on Olive. She had a serene sort of temperament
not easily ruffled; she had brought that from
Maine with her. She talked over her lessons with
Uncle Jason, who seemed to know so many things,
more she thought than Miss Holmes, though she had
taught school in Boston.</p>

<p>She had a host of squirrel friends now, though
Snippy was amusingly jealous, and at times drove the
others off. There were flocks of birds, too, who would
hop up close or circle round her and occasionally light
on her shoulder, and sing deafeningly in her ear, trills
and roulades, such as Mam'selle played on the piano&mdash;she
was not so fond of the organ, it was fit only for
church and convents in the Frenchwoman's estimation.</p>

<p>It was funny to see Balder follow her about. During
the rainy season he found so many puddles in which to
stop and rest and disport himself, but in the dry times
they filled a tub for him, and he was content. Pablo
caught fish for him, and it was his opinion that Balder
lived like some grand Señor. She never tired of the
flowers, and was always finding stray nooks where they
bloomed. She and Miss Holmes often went over to the
ocean and sat on the rocks, looking, wondering.</p>

<p>"Sometime Uncle Jason is going to take me way
over yonder," nodding her head. "We shall go to the
Sandwich Islands, which he says are still more beautiful
than California. And then to China. Perhaps
then all the gates of Japan will be open and they will
let us in. I'd like to see the little girls in Japan; they
don't drown them there, they never have too many.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
And then there will be India, and all those queer
islands. You wouldn't think there would be room for
Australia, which is almost a continent by itself, would
you? The world is very wonderful, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Sometimes they watched magnificent sunsets when
the whole Pacific seemed aflame with gorgeous tints,
for which there could be no name, for they changed as
quick as thought. Then they noted a faint pearl-gray
tint just edging the horizon line, it seemed, and then
spreading out in filmy layers, growing more distinct
and yet darker, marching on like an army. Gulls circled
and screamed, great loons and murres gave their
mournful cry, cormorants swept on, hardly stirring a
wing until, with one swift lurch, they went down and
came up triumphant. Then the sky and sea faded,
though you knew the sea was there because it dashed
upon the rocks, though its tone was curiously muffled.</p>

<p>"Come," Miss Holmes would say, "we shall be
caught in the fog."</p>

<p>"I'd just like to be damp and cold. It has been so
dry that one wants to be wet through and through."</p>

<p>"We shall have to pick our way."</p>

<p>It would sometimes come up very fast, woolly, soft
to the skin, at others like a fine cutting mist, when the
west wind drove it in. And now it was all gray like
a peculiar twilight that made ghosts out of the rocks,
piled about and shut out the Golden Gate and the peaks
beyond, but they drew long breaths of the sea fragrance
that were reviving. The ponies stepped carefully
down this way, and across that level, and then on the
road Pablo was making for his mistress. The ponies
shook their heads and whinnied for very gladness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Bruno gave his cheerful bark. Balder made a funny
grumbling noise as if he were scolding.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know you like the fog. You are dripping
wet," with a hug of tenderness.</p>

<p>They were dripping wet, too, but they soon found
dry clothes. Miss Holmes kindled up the fire, for
Pablo kept them well supplied, though sometimes he
went long distances and came home with a great bundle
on his back that almost bent him double.</p>

<p>"Now you look just like a German peasant," Laverne
would declare; and Pablo would shake his head
mysteriously. The young Missy had seen so many
wonderful things.</p>

<p>Wood was a rather scarce article in this vicinity,
and was expensive. Coal likewise, though now some
had been discovered nearer home. The charcoal venders
were familiar figures in the streets. Wild indeed
would he have been who had ventured to predict a gas
range, even the useful kerosene stove.</p>

<p>The fog storms were all they would have for a time
in the summer, and it was wonderful how in a night
vegetation would start up.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Jason would come in puffing and blowing,
fling off his long, wet coat, and stand before the
fire and declare that Maine people said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"An August fog would freeze a dog,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>which always made Laverne laugh.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes did not go to the ball given in honor of
Miss Isabel Personette, but Miss Gaines was among
the grown people. It was at one of the fine halls used
for such purposes, and was beautifully decorated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
vines and flowers and American flags. The greatest
curiosity was the really splendid chandelier with its
branching burners and glittering prisms. Few of the
real boy friends were invited&mdash;there were enough
young men very glad to come and dance their best.
No one had to entreat them in those days. Indeed,
dancing parties were the great entertainment for young
people. True, women played cards and lost and won
real money, but it was done rather privately and not
considered the thing for any but the seniors.</p>

<p>It was very gay and delightful, quite an ovation to
Miss Personette, and the banquet part eminently satisfactory
to the elders. Of course, Victor Savedra was
included, being a cousin, and went, and it brought
freshly to his mind the party when he had danced with
the sweet, fair-haired, little girl, who had no knowledge,
but infinite grace, and how happy she had been.</p>

<p>Even with politics, city improvements, vigilance committees,
quarrels, and crimes, there was found space in
the papers of the day for the social aspects of life, and
though "sweet girl graduates" had not come in
fashion, débutantes were graciously welcomed. Miss
Isabel felt much elated. She had shot up into a tall
girl and was very well looking. Miss Gaines had
transformed her into beauty.</p>

<p>Olive considered it very hard and cruel that she
could not go, but she was quite a heroine at school for
several days. It was truly the next thing to a wedding.</p>

<p>"And to think of all the splendid things that come
to real young ladies!" she complained, yet there was a
kind of pride in her tone as well. "Two theatre parties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and she goes to Sausalito to a birthday ball, and stays
three days with some very stylish English people,
friends of father's. I just hate being thought a little
schoolgirl! And I want to go to the Seminary."</p>

<p>And then she said to Laverne:</p>

<p>"I don't see what you find in Isola to be so devoted
to her. I wouldn't go over there twice a week and
bother with her for all the music in the world. And
those cold hands of hers make you shiver. They're
like a frog."</p>

<p>"They have grown warmer. She goes to ride every
day now. And we read French and English, and&mdash;verses.
I like the music so much."</p>

<p>Olive was still secretly jealous of Victor. But presently
he was going away to finish his education. And
she knew several boys who went to the Academy that
she thought much more fun. Victor was growing too
sober, too intellectual.</p>

<p>They had all become very fond of the little girl at
the Savedras. Even wild Elena, in a half-bashful way,
copied her. She could run races and climb and ride
the pony with the utmost fearlessness, she did not
squeal over bugs and mice and the little lizards that
came out to sun themselves. Lena had thrown one on
her, and she had never told of it. She was not a bit
like Isola, although she could sit hours over the music
and reading of verses. And she knew so much of those
queer countries where tigers and lions and elephants
lived.</p>

<p>"But you have never been there," the child said
with severe disbelief.</p>

<p>"You study it in books and at school."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"I hate to study!"</p>

<p>"You will love it when you are older. Some day
your father may take you to France, and then you will
want to know the language."</p>

<p>"I know a little of it, enough to talk."</p>

<p>"Mam'selle will be glad to teach you the rest."</p>

<p>"And Spanish&mdash;I knew that first."</p>

<p>"And I had to learn it, and French, with a good deal
of trouble."</p>

<p>"But you knew English," rather jealously.</p>

<p>"Just as you knew Spanish&mdash;in my babyhood."</p>

<p>That seemed very funny, and Lena laughed over it.</p>

<p>"Then you really were a baby, just like Andrea, only
whiter. Will your hair always be goldy like that?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Uncle Jason likes it."</p>

<p>She asked dozens of inconsequent questions.</p>

<p>"You must not let her trouble you so much," Mrs.
Savedra said. "She will have more sense as she grows
older."</p>

<p>Laverne only smiled a little.</p>

<p>Isola found her such a companion, such a listener
as she had never known before. Isabel did not care
for music; Olive teased her, and she put her stolid side
out. She would not get angry and satisfy them. And
then it seemed as if Victor suddenly cared more for
her, and she half unconsciously did some of the things
he suggested. She did not know that Laverne had said
to him, "Oh, you ought to do the things that please
her, and then she will love you. I wish I had a sister."</p>

<p>She wondered a little whom she would want her like?
It was a serious matter to have a sister who would be
with one continually. She was used to Miss Holmes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
and that was more like&mdash;well, like an aunt. Sometimes
she tried to think of her mother, but the remembrance
was vague. She could seem to see her old
grandmother much easier, fretting and scolding.</p>

<p>Victor was glad and proud that she had found a way
to all their hearts.</p>

<p>There were Christmas and New Year's with all their
gayety. And in a month spring, that had run away
from the tropics.</p>

<p>"It goes on too fast," she said to Uncle Jason.
"And do you see how I am growing? Miss Holmes
says something has to be done to my frocks all the
time. I don't want to be big and grown up."</p>

<p>He studied her in amazement. He did not want her
to be big and grown up either. These years were so
satisfying.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<br />
BALDER THE BEAUTIFUL</h2>

<p>They were planning at the school for a May Celebration.
They would go clear up the bay in a boat to San
Pablo, and have a picnic and a dance out of doors, and
come home in the moonlight.</p>

<p>So it was a little late, and Bruno stood watching out
for her. "Good old fellow!" she said, with a pat.
Miss Holmes had a visitor, she saw through the open
window. She went round by the kitchen.</p>

<p>Bruno tugged at her skirt.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bruno?"</p>

<p>His eyes had a sorrowful look, she thought. "What
is it, what do you want?"</p>

<p>He tugged again at her skirt.</p>

<p>"Well, come on. Though I've stacks of lessons to
learn. Look at all those books."</p>

<p>She dropped them on the step, and followed the dog.
Up the winding path, and now there was water enough
for a musical trickle over the stones.</p>

<p>There was Balder's basin, where he was so fond of
disporting himself after the rains filled it up. Oh,
what was that lying on the side, that still white thing
glistening in the sunshine!</p>

<p>"Bruno?" She stamped her foot and looked upbraidingly
at him. Had he been playing roughly with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
her pet? Oh, what was the meaning of these blood-stained
feathers about his neck! She flung herself
down beside him. The eyes were dull and partly
closed. She stroked the white feathers with tender
hands.</p>

<p>"Bruno, I shall never love you again, never! Oh,
how could you!"</p>

<p>He took a few steps away. Then he dragged some
tumbled gray thing to her feet. Why, that was a fox,
with his bushy tail. They had been hunted a good deal
and were giving civilization a rather wide berth.</p>

<p>She looked at the dog, who told the story with his
eyes as he glanced from one to the other. She reached
up and put her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bruno, I'm sorry I blamed you. I thought
perhaps you were a little rough, but you cared so for
my beautiful Balder that I might have known you
couldn't hurt him! And that wicked, wretched fox!
Well, I am glad he has his deserts. But that will not
bring back my dear Balder. Oh, have you gone to
join the old heroes in Valhalla? For I can't think you
were just a common bird. You would have gone back
to your kind if you had been. I ought to write a
lament for you."</p>

<p>Pablo was coming up the road with a back load of
brush. But he dropped it in dismay as she called.</p>

<p>Bruno pawed the fox, then gave it a push, and
glanced up at Pablo.</p>

<p>"You see&mdash;the fox must have crept up here, and
seized my dear Balder by the neck and killed him.
And Bruno made him pay for it."</p>

<p>When Pablo was deeply moved or amazed, he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
back to his Mexican patois, that Bruno had come to
understand very well, and nodded sagaciously.</p>

<p>"The thief! The murderer! Last year, you know,
your uncle and I shot two of the bloody thieves over
the ridge there, and I've not seen one since. Bruno
seized him by the throat, and has torn him well. Look
at the brush&mdash;why, a lady could put it on her tippet.
And the skin&mdash;I'll have that. We'll throw him out to
feed the hawks. Oh, the poor gull! He was like
folks, Missy, you had all trained him so much. Oh,
don't cry so, Missy."</p>

<p>Bruno came up and rubbed her shoulder, licked her
hand, and gave a low, mournful lament of sympathy.</p>

<p>Laverne rose and took the dead bird in her arms.
The visitor had gone, and Miss Holmes stood out by
the door, wondering. The procession took their way
thither.</p>

<p>"The mean, sneaking brute, that he should have
come just when I had gone. The bird was so fond of
paddling round there. Strange that he never wanted
to go with his kind, but most things want to keep by
you, Missy."</p>

<p>They told the sad story over. Laverne laid the gull
down tenderly on a bit of matting.</p>

<p>"Pablo, will you wash his neck and have him all
clean and white?"</p>

<p>"My dear," Miss Holmes said, and clasped the child
in her arms, letting her cry out her sorrow. She and
Bruno went down to meet Uncle Jason presently. No
grief, hardly a disappointment, had come near her
until now. How could he comfort his darling? And
he felt with Pablo that the bird had been almost human.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," he said in the evening, "if you would
like to have him mounted. There's an old Frenchman
down in Rincon Street who does this to perfection.
The birds look alive."</p>

<p>Laverne considered. "No, I believe I would rather
have him buried. I should think how the sly fox crept
up and dragged him out before he could turn to defend
himself. We will put him in a box and bury him.
Oh, Balder, I shall miss you so much."</p>

<p>"I think I could capture one easily."</p>

<p>"To be sure you could. They're stupid things,"
subjoined Pablo.</p>

<p>"But he wasn't. Uncle Jason, I think some wicked
fairy changed him from something else, for he used
to look at times as if he had a story in his eyes. No,
I don't want another. And I should always be afraid
of a fox."</p>

<p>He snuggled her up with his arm close about her.
So they sat until the stars came out, twinkling like
live spirits in the cloudless blue. It was warm, with
all manner of odors in the air, and the hum of the
city, lying below them, came up faintly. Oh, how he
loved her. And he prayed there might never come
any deeper sorrow to touch her tender heart.</p>

<p>Pablo dug a grave the next morning, and they
buried Balder the beautiful. All day she dreamed
of the Norse gods, and of Hermod, who took the
journey to the barred gates of Hell, at Frigga's earnest
persuasion, and how every rock, and tree and all living
things wept for him, except one old hag, sitting in the
mouth of a cavern, who refused because she hated him,
and so Balder could not return. She was a little absent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and missed two or three questions, and Miss Bain
asked her if her head ached, she made such an effort
to keep the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>So Balder slept under a straight young pine near
the little lake they had made for him. Pablo skinned
the fox with great zest, and made of it a fine rug, with
a strip of black bearskin for a border.</p>

<p>She wondered whether she ought to feel merry
enough to go on the May party. But the children insisted.
The boat was a fine strong one, and there
really was no danger; Uncle Jason was assured of that.
Then it was such a glorious day. There was a fog
early in the morning, and the fight between the golden
arrows of the sun and the gray armor that came up out
of the sea. Sometimes it did conquer, and came over
the city, but this morning it was pierced here and there,
and then torn to tatters, driven out beyond the strait,
into the ocean.</p>

<p>Miss Bain took supervision of her scholars, and Miss
Holmes had many charges not to let the little girl out
of her sight a moment. There were a number of
schools, but some of the children preferred the May
walk, and the treat afterward. They started off with
flags flying, and the young Geary Band had volunteered
their services. There were a drum, two fifes,
a cornet, and a French horn, and the boys began with
the stirring patriotic tunes. But even here the old
negro melodies had found their way, many of them
pathetic reminders of the cotton fields of the South,
that seemed to gain melody from the stretch of bay.</p>

<p>They passed Fort Point and Alcatraz Island, where
the government was beginning magnificent defences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
its high point looming up grandly. Angel Island, then
almost covered with a forest of oak, yet oddly enough
containing a fine quarry, where laborers were at work,
hewing into the rock, almost under the shadow of the
waving trees. Yerba Buena, with its fragrant odors
blown about by the wind, smaller islands, big rocks
rising out of the sea, the inhabitants being chiefly birds;
vessels of nearly every description, and intent mostly
upon trade, plied hither and thither. Here was
another strait opening into San Pablo Bay, into which
emptied creeks and rivers, the Sacramento washing
down golden sands; and the San Joaquin. And up
there was the wonderful land where the Argonauts
were searching for treasure with less toil and anxiety
than the elder Jason, though here, too, there were
treachery and murder.</p>

<p>Almost by the strait there was a beautiful point of
land jutting out in the water, and nearly covered with
magnificent trees, that had grown so close together
that the branches interlaced and made arches, while
underneath were aisles, carpeted with fallen leaves
and moss, that made you feel as if you were walking
over velvet. You could see San Raphael and San
Quentin, and the mountain range with the one high
peak, as you looked westward; eastward there was,
after the woodland, meadows of richest verdure, with
their thousand blooms nodding gayly to each other, and
softly gossiping, perhaps about these strange newcomers,
who were presently to disturb their long, long
possessorship. There the great, grand Sierras, that
looked so near in the marvellously clear air.</p>

<p>They found a choice spot, and built a fire&mdash;it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
not have been a picnic without that. There were boys,
of course, though a girl was restricted to a brother or
cousin. I fancy some cousins were smuggled in.
They ran about; they were even young enough to
play "tag," and "blind man in a ring," and "fox and
geese," which was the greatest fun of all. Then they
spread out their tablecloths on a level space, and
though real paper plates and thin wooden ones had not
come in yet, they had made some for themselves that
answered the purpose. They were merry enough with
jests and laughter.</p>

<p>Olive Personette was quite the heroine of the day.
Miss Isabel's engagement to Captain Gilbert, who had
been appointed to take some charge at Alcatraz, and
had come of an old Californian family, beside being
educated at West Point, was still a topic of interest,
because there had been two other aspirants for her
hand who had quarrelled and fought a duel, which
was quite an ordinary matter in those days, though
frowned upon by the best people. So neither had
won her heart. One was lying in the hospital, the
other had fled northward. But it had made quite a
stir.</p>

<p>Of course, she had asked Victor, importuned him,
though he had meant all the time to come. He was a
fine, manly fellow now, and the girls <i>did</i> flock about
him. He had such a grave, courteous manner, and
never descended into rudeness, though he was quick
enough at fun, and it does not need an intricate order
of wit to amuse before one is twenty.</p>

<p>Olive picked out the most prominent girls for him,
and kept him busy enough. But he managed now and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
then to pass Laverne and say a word to show that she
was in his mind.</p>

<p>"I think Isola wanted to come very much," he announced
to her once. "She's taking such an interest
in the pleasures that girls have, and she has grown
stronger. Father is planning some day to take a sail
all around the bay, just a little party of us, and we
want you and Miss Holmes."</p>

<p>That was such a delight. She did not refuse to talk
to other boys, but she liked the girls better. Her
rather secluded life had not given her so much interest
in hunting and fishing and ball-playing and race-running.
Then on Sunday there was always horse-racing
up on the track by the old Mission. Church-going
people, not really members, but those who considered it
the proper thing to pay a decorous attention to religion,
went to church in the morning and drove out in the
afternoon. Throngs of fine carriages, and handsomely
dressed ladies, men on horseback, with enough of the
old-style attire to stamp them as Mexican, Spanish, or
the more than half Old Californian. Many of the
more successful ones began to plume themselves on a
sort of aristocracy.</p>

<p>The boys knew the favorite horses, some of their
fathers owned a fast trotter. But somehow she did
not care much to talk about them, though she had gone
out occasionally with Uncle Jason, and it was exciting
to witness the trials of speed. But she liked better to
jog about on Pelajo and talk in the lovely by-paths
they were always finding.</p>

<p>After the repast they swung in hammocks and
talked over plans, or rambled about, then the band
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
played for dancing. No gathering would have been
perfect without that. Of course, they flirted a little,
that was in the young blood, but they came home
merry, and had not disputed unduly about their respective
admirers.</p>

<p>Victor found time to say that he should come over
next Saturday. "We'll have a nice time, all to ourselves,"
he whispered, and she glanced up with delighted
eyes.</p>

<p>All her life thus far had been very quiet, in spite of
the fact that she was in such a turbulent place, and
with all sorts of people, gathered from the ends of the
earth; where seldom a day passed without some
tragedy. And it seemed as if the city was coming
nearer and nearer, though it went southward, too, and
all along the bay, docks and wharves and warehouses
were springing up in a night.</p>

<p>Victor came over the following Saturday as he had
promised. They sat under the pine tree and wrote
verses to Balder's memory. Victor had found a volume
of Scandinavian legends and poems, and they were
fascinated with it.</p>

<p>"Of course, we can't write anything like that," she
said simply, "but you notice these do not rhyme. Do
you not think it really grander, tenderer?"</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"I heard a voice that cried</p>
<p>'Balder the Beautiful</p>
<p>Is dead, is dead!</p>
<p>And through the misty air,</p>
<p>Passed like the mournful cry</p>
<p>Of sunward sailing cranes.'"</p>
</div></div>

<p>"You repeat poetry so beautifully," he exclaimed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
enchanted with the pathetic voice, that could express
so much, yet was so simply sweet.</p>

<p>They were not born poets. He had great trouble
about his Latin hexameters. He could feel it floating
through his brain, but it was very elusive, vanishing
before it was caught. She made a few little lines without
rhyming.</p>

<p>Then he told her of the other god that had ruled a
realm of lovely thoughts, until, as the legend ran, when
Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, was born, a great
groan was heard all over the isles of Greece, the rushes
bowed their heads, and the waves shuddered when it
was proclaimed that Olympus was dethroned, and Pan
was dead.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i0">"And that dismal cry rose slowly,</p>
<p class="i1">And sank slowly through the air,</p>
<p class="i1">Full of spirit's melancholy</p>
<p class="i1">And eternity's despair</p>
<p>As they heard the words it said&mdash;</p>
<p>Pan is dead, great Pan is dead&mdash;</p>
<p class="i8">Pan, Pan is dead."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And then, as they listened, the gulls' cry came to
them, toned by the distance, softened by the murmur of
the wind into a requiem for the dead Balder.</p>

<p>After all he did not tell her what he had meant to.
He would put off the evil day.</p>

<p>Everybody&mdash;children, I mean&mdash;was anxious about
examinations. Very few really longed for them, but
there was the vacation beyond.</p>

<p>She had been wandering about one afternoon, Bruno
keeping close to her side, though there was little to
call strangers up this way. The view was finer from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the Presidio, and the principal fishing ground was
farther down below. So, when Bruno gave a growl,
she started and glanced about, and saw some one toiling
over the rocks with a cane. A very old woman it
seemed, as she leaned upon her stick, and hardly knew
which way to go.</p>

<p>"Hush, Bruno, hush!" she commanded.</p>

<p>The figure came nearer. Bruno was not at all
pleased with it.</p>

<p>The rough hair was a grayish white. A flowered
handkerchief was tied over it with a knot that hid the
chin. The garments were coarse and faded, the short
skirt of a Mexican woman, and clumsy shoes.</p>

<p>"It is Laverne Chadsey." Something in the voice
connected it with the past. And now that she straightened
herself up, she was quite tall.</p>

<p>"But I don't know you," Laverne said, rather hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Then the disguise must be very good. I am an old&mdash;shall
I say, old friend? We were not very warm
friends when I knew you."</p>

<p>Was it a school friend playing a prank?</p>

<p>"I am so tired." She dropped down on a stone.
"I wanted to see you first&mdash;I am a little afraid of Miss
Holmes." Then she pulled off the headgear, afterward
the gray wig.</p>

<p>Laverne stood astounded. "It isn't, it surely isn't
Carmen Estenega!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes; you know you saw me last at the
Convent."</p>

<p>"And you were going to be married."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a blind idiot I was! But it was considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
a great thing, and I didn't know how any one
might love then. I know now. I have run away. I
would kill myself sooner than marry Pascuel Estenega."</p>

<p>Laverne drew a long breath. Yes, this really was
Carmen. The eyes, the mouth, when she talked, but
there was a fire in the face that had not been there in
childhood, and a spirit that half frightened Laverne.</p>

<p>"I want to see your uncle. I have a note to him,
from&mdash;from a person he has confidence in. And I
want to tell him my story. I think men take a different
view, of some things, at least I believe he will,
and another person thinks so."</p>

<p>She blushed as she uttered this.</p>

<p>"You ran away&mdash;from the Convent?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was very skilfully planned. They were
not quite so strict&mdash;I was to be married in a month,
there in the chapel, and they allowed me time to myself.
I had a&mdash;a girl devoted to me, who did embroidery
and sewing, and she carried notes. Then
there was a place in the old garden where the railing
was broken, but it was hidden by the shrubbery. A
girl had seen a snake there, and no one would go near
it. We used to meet there when his vessel came in.
And it was all planned."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;who? Not&mdash;&mdash;" and Laverne hardly knew
how to put her question.</p>

<p>"Oh, not Pascuel Estenega. He love a girl!"</p>

<p>The face seemed to quiver with scornful indignation,
and the eyes fairly blazed.</p>

<p>"He is an American. He is in the employ of your
uncle, and he will be good to us both. Perhaps in his
youth he knew what love was. We are going to trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
him. He comes up with the trading vessel on Saturday.
He put me on another, the <i>Lulita</i>, an old Spanish
thing, and I was an old Mexican woman. No one
suspected. We came in at noon, and I walked off.
Gracious! how the world has changed. I had to ask
the way; no one paid any attention to an old woman
with a stick, and bent in the shoulders."</p>

<p>She gave a triumphant laugh.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;your marriage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She seemed to study Laverne from head to foot, and
the girl shrank a little.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother, what a child you are! Not in long
skirts yet! And you know nothing about love; but you
may some day. Not like the heat that is in the Spanish
blood, when it is roused, but many a woman is given
in marriage who knows no more about it than a child.
Papa Estenega came to see me when I had been in the
Convent some months. I do not understand, but
mamacita has some old portraits and archives and
jewels, that came from Spain, and we are the last of
the two houses. He was very anxious for these, and
mamacita had no son. So when she came they signed
a marriage contract. Pascuel had been ill, and the
doctor had taken him away for his health. We went
out to the estate. It is a splendid old place. I was
very proud then of being chosen as its mistress. Well,
perhaps I held my head too lofty. Then I heard that
years before Pascuel had wedded a young girl, and
when her baby was born dead, he treated her very
bitterly, and one night she threw herself down an old
well, though it was said she had gone out of her mind.
He came to the convent after a while, and I thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
I should faint when I saw him. He was a shrunken-up
thing, a good head shorter than his father. Oh, I
do believe I could have married Papa Estenega more
willingly. His eyes were small and cruel, he had a
great mustache, over a hanging lip, and his hair was
already turning white. Then I began to place some
credence in what one of the girls said, and repeated it
to mamacita. Panchita was sent away from school
the next week, and no one knew just why. Mamacita
would not hear a word, and said it was sheer envy;
that any girl would be proud of reigning there, and
being the mother of an Estenega heir. And then I
saw Señor José Hudson, the American, and my heart
seemed to go out of me at once. We talked with our
eyes, and then he sent me a note. He came to church
two or three times, but of course we hardly dared look
at each other. He found this broken place, and I used
to steal down there. Oh, it was delicious! I told him
all the story, and he said we would run away and that
I should be his wife. He had no estate, but he could
make enough money to take care of me, and that we
would go farther north, and be, oh, so happy with
each other. So I seemed to give in, and fretted
mamacita no more, and they began with the trousseau.
Señor Hudson planned it all, and brought me the wig
and the garments. And one day, just dusk, I
slipped out, a lame old woman, and a servant took me
to the boat. He was waiting there, and we had a talk.
You see, it would not have been best for me to come
on his boat. When he asked me if I had any trusty
friend in San Francisco, I spoke of you, and he said,
'Oh, that is my master. Jason Chadsey owns the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
boat. I have worked for him two years. Go straight
to him and he will befriend you.' So he wrote the
letter I have in my hand. I could not seek him in
that busy place, where there were crowds of men
around, so I found my way up here. Juana had written
me about it, though I was frightened at every step.
And I found you. I saw you up here with the dog.
You know in that old time I did not care much for you,
we were taught that the Americanos were interlopers,
and would sweep us out of our homes, drive us, heaven
only knew where, but now, because I have found one so
sweet and noble and tender, I can see the virtues and
graces in you all. And I know you will befriend me."</p>

<p>She knelt suddenly at Laverne's feet, and snatching
her hands, covered them with kisses. Isola Savedra
sometimes did this. The child was confused, helpless.</p>

<p>"And the Señor Chadsey will be good to me for the
sake of Señor Hudson. It will be only two days. And
will you beseech your Señora to be kind and pitiful,
and to pardon this attire, as if I was a beggar?"</p>

<p>A bell rang then. It was Miss Holmes' call for a
return home, a warning that it was near supper time.</p>

<p>"Come," Laverne said. She was still bewildered,
but led the way. And there, turning round the corner,
she saw Uncle Jason, so she ran forward with outstretched
arms, her light hair flying like a cloud.</p>

<p>"Well, little one!" smiling fondly.</p>

<p>"Something so queer has happened." She was out
of breath, and flushed, for her heart was beating tremendously.
"Carmen Estenega is here and she is
going to marry the man you have talked about, Joseph
Hudson."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the vessel has not come in, will not be in
until Saturday."</p>

<p>"Yes. She wants to wait here for him. Oh, Uncle
Jason, you will be good to her. She has run away
from the convent, and it is like a story from a book.
Come!"</p>

<p>Carmencita stood where Laverne had left her. For
the first time she began to feel frightened. "Oh," she
cried, "have pity on me; do not send me away until
Señor Hudson comes, and you will see that my story
is true."</p>

<p>"What is all this?" He looked from one to the
other. Miss Holmes came out. Then Carmen turned
scarlet, remembering her attire.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;" Miss Holmes looked her over.</p>

<p>"Carmencita Estenega, who asks shelter for two
days, and prays that you will not betray her to a cruel
life. Oh, like the other poor lady, I should drown
myself."</p>

<p>"You have run away from a convent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, let me explain!"</p>

<p>She told the story over again as they stood there,
now her voice athrill with love, now piteous with entreaty.
And it did move Jason Chadsey's heart. Besides,
he had found the young fellow trusty, and liked
him, and his note was very straightforward.</p>

<p>"We will talk more at length about it," he said
gravely, "and I dare say supper is ready."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<br />
A WEDDING AND A PARTING</h2>

<p>Miss Holmes led her guest to her room, where she
might refresh herself, and provided her with some
garments, as they were nearly of a size. Carmen was
too excited to be hungry. She did not attempt to
disguise her dislike and fear for the man chosen to
be her husband, but Chadsey knew family fortunes
were often united that way, and girls had little voice in
the matter. That she loved young Hudson was quite
apparent. Miss Holmes smiled. She had thought Carmen
a rather proud, stolid girl, quite captious about
Americans.</p>

<p>Jason and Miss Holmes considered after the girls
had gone to bed. It was a rather risky thing to harbor
her and consent to a marriage, but the escape had
been so well managed, they would hardly look for her
in the city. Telegraphs did not flash news from everywhere
then.</p>

<p>"But suppose this young man is not quite trustworthy?"
said prudent Miss Holmes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know Hudson. He is straight as a
yardstick. And, somehow, I hate to spoil the romance
and the love. We can wait until Saturday. Yes, I
think that will be better."</p>

<p>Laverne was not to go to school the next day, lest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
she might inadvertently touch upon the adventure.
And so the two girls steeped themselves in Romance.
Carmen had heard more than one confidence within the
cloistered walls that had never gone to confession.
There were girls with their destinies mapped out
before them as hers had been, sent there to keep them
from the grasp of another love which had already
caught them, girls praying for husbands with the life
of a nun before them. They went out and sat under
the pine tree.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Carmen, "if you have had no greater
love and no greater sorrow than that for a bird, your
life has flowed evenly enough. But you Americanos
are so much colder of blood."</p>

<p>In the main, it was a wonderful day to Laverne, but
she felt that she did not need any other love than that
of Uncle Jason.</p>

<p>"You are such a child," Carmen said almost pityingly.
Yet it was an unknown childhood to her.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes brought down one of her frocks, that,
with a spasm of economy, she had meant to make over
for the child. She had grown a little stouter in this
wonderful climate, and could not wear it. She glanced
at the slender virginal form, and decided what could
be done. Carmen was handy with her needle, there
had been need enough in her straitened life.</p>

<p>No one came near them. Pablo had forgotten about
the Estenegas, or thought of them vaguely as children,
and this was a friend of Missy's.</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey was much puzzled what course to
pursue. The right way seemed to be to send word to
the Señora Estenega. But the tidings could just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
well be sent if he found Joseph Hudson untrustworthy.
The vessel came in Saturday afternoon. The master
was watching out, and saw Mr. Chadsey on the
pier. He waved his broad-fronted tarpaulin, and was
answered by the return wave of a hand. There were
some orders to give, the boat was made fast, and Hudson
sprang ashore. And as the elder man looked full
into the young, trusty face, his heart went out to the
lovers, and he resolved to befriend them.</p>

<p>So he brought him home to supper, and it was
planned that they would go over to Sausalito on the
morrow and find a priest to marry them. Then he
must secure a vessel going northward, and be out of
the way some months at least, for he knew Spanish
vengeance was quick and sharp. He had heard a
few stories about Pascuel Estenega's treatment of servants
that were rather chilling. The matter had been
so well managed that he had not been suspicioned at
all, and when the vessel left Monterey, the disappearance
had not been whispered outside the convent walls.
But that was not to say no search had been made.</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey accompanied them, and stood as sort
of sponsor for the marriage. The priest was old and
not inquisitive, or perhaps the fee in hand convinced
him that all things were right. The sponsor was curiously
touched by the unalloyed delight of the young
couple, who seemed now so perfectly content that they
made love in the most unabashed fashion, while before,
Carmen had appeared shy and in terror.</p>

<p>They returned to the home that had sheltered them,
and Hudson thought it best to take some trip up northward,
perhaps settle there for a while. Already there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
was much trading up to the Columbia River. Chadsey
hated to give up so trusty and capable a man. He
might fit out a vessel with miscellaneous stores; indeed,
that was the way to carry trade to strange places.
He would put Joseph Hudson in as captain, and leave
the bargain-making in his hands.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes did some shopping for the young wife,
as it was not deemed prudent for Carmen to venture
out. She longed ardently to see her little sisters, and
begged that Laverne might go and call on them. The
latter had not seen them for a long while, the watchful
sister had discouraged any intimacy.</p>

<p>Laverne had begun school on Monday with many
injunctions from Miss Holmes to be most watchful
over herself. She had a wonderful secret now. Olive
Personette never had had anything like it, for her sister's
engagement had been announced at once. And she
was so full of that, and the marriage in the early autumn,
that she could hardly steady her mind sufficiently
to pass her examinations. Then she was going to
the Academy next year. They were all young ladies
in the department, you had nothing to do with little
girls. There were to be three bridesmaids, and their
attendants were to wear full military costumes.</p>

<p>"Don't you think I might go over to the sisters?"
Laverne pleaded. "I would be very, very cautious.
Carmen wants so to hear about them."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes was almost afraid, but the pleading
eyes conquered.</p>

<p>She went after school. There was the long, bare
corridor, with one table and a big registry book, two
wooden benches, and a few chairs. The adobe floor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
had been painted gray, like the walls, and it looked
cheerless to the American girl.</p>

<p>Sister Anasticia was not quite sure. The children
were busy with the study hour. But Laverne pleaded
with the same eyes that she had won Miss Holmes, and
presently the sister brought the children in, and seated
herself at the table with some needlework.</p>

<p>They were full of quiet joy, and squeezed Laverne's
hands with the old friendliness. And they had so
much to tell her. Carmen was to be married soon, the
wedding gowns were being made, and they were beautiful.
The old home had been dismantled, the city
was to cut streets through it. They did not care, it
was a lonely old place. They were going to Monterey
to live, and they were so glad. Carmen would be a
great lady, and live on a fine estate, ride around in her
carriage, and give balls, and they would all be so happy.</p>

<p>Juana resembled her mother in face and figure.
But Anesta had shot up into a tall girl, and suggested
Carmencita, carried her head rather haughtily.</p>

<p>The sister rapped on the table with her thimble, raising
her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are too noisy and too frivolous," she said,
with severity.</p>

<p>They kissed each other good-by.</p>

<p>"I wish we could come over and see you," Juana
whispered. "We always had such a good time. Perhaps
you will come to Monterey," wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I shall," was the hopeful reply.</p>

<p>Carmen was so glad to hear about them, and how
they looked, and if they seemed happy. She had considered
writing letters to them a great hardship, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
she felt she could fill pages and pages. She wondered
how it was that her heart was so overflowing with love.
And the thought that she might never see them again
filled her eyes with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do wonder if Pascuel will desire to marry
either of the girls?" she cried in half affright.</p>

<p>"But if he is so old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That doesn't seem to matter where there is
money. And Papa Estenega wanted both branches of
the family united. And if I had not had a son!"</p>

<p>She shuddered, thinking of the poor wife who had
drowned herself.</p>

<p>It was not until the last of the week that Captain
Hudson was ready to start with his venture. Carmen
packed her plain trousseau, and was most grateful for
all the kindness.</p>

<p>"I shall see you sometime again," she said, in a
broken voice, "but not in quite a while. It will be
best to stay until they have forgotten about me. I
shall be cast out, you know. They will take my name
off the books, and excommunicate me, I think. But I
shall be an American, and you do not fear such things,
so I will try not to. Oh, how good you have all been
to me. I can never repay, but I shall pray night and
morning, and you will live in my thoughts."</p>

<p>They started out Saturday afternoon. Jason Chadsey
pressed a roll of money in the bride's hands. In
those days wedding gifts were pure friendship. There
would be a full moon, and they could sail all night, for
a full moon on the Pacific Coast was something really
beyond description. Jason Chadsey sat out on the step
enjoying it. He always felt beauty keenly, though he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
had no words for it. This was why he delighted in
the child's prattle. She had so much imagination.</p>

<p>Had he been young once and loved like that?
Young people of to-day put their love in passionate
words, rapturous kisses. They were not afraid of
making it the best thing of life, as it was. And his
love had only sipped the dregs.</p>

<p>Was Laverne crying? "What is it, dear?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The house seems so lonely, just as if some one had
been buried, as it did when Balder was killed. Uncle
Jason, couldn't we go somewhere? Or if something
would happen again. I liked Captain Hudson so
much. And Carmencita has grown so sweet. Oh, it
has been such a lovely week, but it went so rapidly.
Does the time pass quickly when you are happy, and
slowly when you are a little dull?"</p>

<p>"But you have me," he said jealously.</p>

<p>"I couldn't live without you." She nestled closer.</p>

<p>"I want you always, always."</p>

<p>"And sometime we might go up North. It is a
queer, wild country, grand, but not as beautiful as the
southland, with its millions of flowers. Something like
Maine, I reckon."</p>

<p>"I've almost forgotten about Maine."</p>

<p>"Up there the mountain peaks are covered with
snow the year round."</p>

<p>"Then it is like the Alps."</p>

<p>"And the great Columbia River. No towns to
speak of, but stations, hunters, and trappers, and fur
animals, and wildness of every kind, game of every
kind."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Something of the old adventurous life stirred within
him. But he had the little girl. And when they began
their travels, she would be older and have a taste
for beautiful things.</p>

<p>Yes, the house <i>did</i> seem lonesome, but Laverne was
very busy, and events began to happen. Mrs. Folsom
made another move, this time to quite a fine family
hotel, and she gave a housewarming on going in.
Old friends, there were not many of them, and new
friends, of whom there was an abundance, for she
was a favorite as a householder. Dick had grown
up into a jaunty, well-looking young fellow, and had
not plunged into ruinous excesses, partly because his
mother had kept a sharp oversight, and the rest his
clean New England stamina, the wrecks had filled him
with disgust and repulsion.</p>

<p>All the old friends met, of course. Mrs. Dawson
was rosy and plump, and had retired to a stylish house
with servants and carriage. The Dawson Café was
one of the better-class institutions of the town, and
coining money. Miss Gaines stood at the head of
fashionable modistes, and there was no appeal from
her dictum. You could accept her style or go elsewhere.
There had been offers of marriage, too, she
laughingly admitted to her friends. "Ten years ago
I should have accepted one of them gratefully; now
I value my independence."</p>

<p>Dick Folsom went over to Laverne.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen you in so long and you have grown
so, I hardly knew you," he said. "May I beg the
honor of your hand for this quadrille?"</p>

<p>She was quite longing to dance and accepted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"We oughtn't forget each other after that five
months' journey together," he remarked in one of
the pauses. "Does it ever seem queer to you, as if
it was something you dreamed? I can't make it real.
But they've improved the overland so much, and when
we get the railroad&mdash;presto; you will see a change!
If we were only nearer England. But there's China,
if we are not swamped by the pigtails and pointed
slippers! How queer they are! We don't need to
go to foreign lands to study the nations. I sometimes
wonder what the outcome of all this conglomeration
will be!"</p>

<p>"We are so far off," she replied in a sort of tentative
fashion. "It's almost like another town."</p>

<p>"Yes. They'll tumble you down presently, as they
did before. You wouldn't know the old place, would
you? They've carted away stones and débris to fill
up the marshy edges of the bay. And there's a
long, straight street, a drive out to fine country
ways. Is there any other land so full of flowers, I
wonder!"</p>

<p>"And they are so royally lovely. Think of great
patches of callas in blossom nearly all the time. Miss
Holmes said when she was at home she used to nurse
up one to blossom about Easter. If she had two flowers
she thought it quite a marvel."</p>

<p>What a soft, musical laugh the child had! They
used to run races on the boat, he remembered, and he
had enough boyish gallantry to let her win. They
ought to be dear old friends.</p>

<p>"Do you ever go out to drive on Sunday afternoon?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Uncle Jason's day, the only leisure he has.
And we spend it together."</p>

<p>"He's had stunning luck, too. Getting to be a rich
man."</p>

<p>"Is he?" she said simply.</p>

<p>"Is he? Well, you ought to know," laughing.</p>

<p>"He doesn't talk much about business."</p>

<p>"A great country this is for making fortunes! The
trouble is that you can spend them so easily. But I'm
bound to hold on to mine, when I get it made."</p>

<p>Some one else took her. He looked after her. She
would be a pretty girl presently and quite worth considering.
He had a good opinion of himself, and was
not going to be lightly thrown away.</p>

<p>They trudged up the hill just after midnight. Laverne
was gay and chatty, recounting her good times.
It seemed as if she had as much attention as Olive
from the younger men, and Olive was always so proud
of that.</p>

<p>Uncle Jason gave a sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried, "you look tired. Don't you like
parties? I thought it splendid!"</p>

<p>"I'm getting old, dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't get old!" she interrupted impulsively.
"Why can't people turn back a little somewhere
along, and be young again? For, you know, I
can't get old very fast, and I think&mdash;yes, I am quite
sure I don't want to. I'm having such a splendid time
since you were so lovely to Carmen, and made her
happy. I sometimes think if you had sent her back to
Monterey&mdash;but you couldn't have done that, could
you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>"No, dear," he answered softly.</p>

<p>He had heard a point discussed this evening that
did trouble him a little. They were talking of lowering
Telegraph Hill again. He was not ready to go yet.
In two years maybe. She would not have any lovers
by that time, and then they could start off together.
He must not grow old too fast.</p>

<p>The next happening in their little circle did interest
her a good deal. Howard Personette had finished his
year's term at college, and come home quite unexpectedly,
when his father had intended him to finish
and take a degree.</p>

<p>"I'm not a student, I'm convinced of that," he announced
rather doggedly. "I don't see any sense in
keeping at what you don't like, and don't mean to follow.
I want the stir and rush of business instead of
splitting hairs about this and that. I've been awfully
homesick the last year, and dissatisfied, but I knew you
would not agree to my coming home, so I just came.
And if there's nothing else for me to do, I'll go to
work on the streets."</p>

<p>Students were expected to study in those days.
Athletics had not come in for their diversion. Mr.
Personette was disappointed. He wanted to make a
lawyer out of his son, and to lay a good foundation for
the years to come.</p>

<p>Mrs. Personette rather sympathized with the eager
young fellow, who was ready to take up any active life.</p>

<p>"The East is so different," he explained. "Perhaps
if I hadn't been born here and breathed this free, exhilarating
air all my life, I might have toned myself
down and stayed. But I had begun to hate books,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and what was the use maundering away several
years?"</p>

<p>Olive thought him quite a hero. Captain Franklin
said if there was any lack of employment in the city
he could come out to Alcantraz. They would be very
glad to have a fellow who was not afraid to work.</p>

<p>"Why, I should feel proud of him, shouldn't you?"
Laverne asked of Uncle Jason.</p>

<p>"That depends," he answered, with a shake of the
head.</p>

<p>But if one came home from an indifference to study,
another was going to take a greater absence. Four
years without coming home at all! The journey was
long and expensive, and there seemed a better use for
vacations.</p>

<p>This was Victor Savedra, who had many student
longings. And so one afternoon the two sat out under
the pine, their favorite place, and he was explaining
to Laverne his plans for a few years to come.</p>

<p>"Father wanted me to go to Paris," he said. "If
I meant to be a physician, I think I would. But first
and last and always I mean to be an American citizen.
I suppose I might go to Yale or Harvard, but that
seems almost as far away, and my choice appears more
satisfactory all around," smiling a little. "We like
the new, but we have a hankering for the old civilizations,
and the accretions of knowledge."</p>

<p>They both looked out over the Golden Gate, the
ocean. There were dancing sails, jungles of masts,
cordage like bits of webs, tossing whitecaps in strong
contrast to the blue, and over beyond, the green, wooded
shores. The old semaphore's gaunt arms were dilapidated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and it was to come down. But it had thrilled
hundreds of hearts with its tidings that friends, neighbors,
and greatest joy of all, letters from loved ones in
lands that seemed so distant then.</p>

<p>Now the lack of rain had dried up vegetation, except
the cactus and some tufts of hardy grass. The little
rivulet was spent, there was only a bed of stones. But
they had managed to keep something green and inviting
about the house. A riotous Madeira vine flung
out long streamers of fragrant white blooms that
seemed to defy fate laughingly. Down below they
were levelling again, this time for a last grade, it was
said.</p>

<p>"It will all be so changed when I return. I wonder
where you will go? For you cannot climb up to this
eyrie. You would be perhaps a hundred feet up.
They want the sand and the débris to fill in the big
piers they are building. Why, they will almost sweep
the great hill away, but they will have to leave the
rocks by the sea. It will be a new San Francisco."</p>

<p>"Why, it is almost new now," and she smiled.</p>

<p>"Everything will have changed. And we shall
change, too. I shall be twenty-three when I come
back."</p>

<p>Laverne looked at him wonderingly. They had all
been big boys to her, and she had been a little girl.
True, he had grown to man's estate in height, and there
was a dainty line of darkness on his upper lip. It had
been so imperceptible that just now it seemed new to
her.</p>

<p>"And I shall be&mdash;why, I shall be past nineteen then,"
she commented in surprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"And&mdash;and married," he hazarded. The thought
gave him a pang, for that was new, too.</p>

<p>"No," she returned, looking up at him out of innocent
eyes, while the faint rose tint in her cheek never
deepened. "No, I shall not be married in a long, long
time. Presently Uncle Jason and Miss Holmes and I
are to set out on a journey, just as they do in some
of the stories. We shall go to the strange lands he
tells me about, we shall see the people in their native
element," and she smiled at the conceit, "where we
see only a dozen or two here. What do you suppose
draws them to California?"</p>

<p>"Why, the stories of gold, of course." Their coming
and going did not interest him. "I wonder if you
will be in London?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. I want to see the Queen and the
palaces, and Edinburgh, and Holyrood, and all the
places those proud old Scots fought over, and poor
Marie Stuart! And Sweden and Norway, and the
midnight sun, and the Neva, and St. Petersburg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, out of breath.</p>

<p>"London is what interests me," he interposed.
"And if you could come over next summer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, it won't be next summer,
but it may be the year after," she returned gravely.</p>

<p>"And if it was my vacation. Then I might join
you for a few weeks."</p>

<p>"That would be splendid." Her soft eyes glowed.</p>

<p>"I shall keep thinking of that."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you? Then I will think of it, too. And
it is queer how time runs away. You hardly notice
it until the bells ring out for New Year's."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;if you will miss me any?" and his
voice fell a trifle, though he tried to keep anxiety out
of it.</p>

<p>"Miss you? Why, of course!" She was full of
wondering, and to him, delicious surprise. "We have
been such friends, haven't we? Ever since that night
you showed me about the dancing? I've been amazed
since that I had the courage, when I hardly knew a
step, but after all it was very much like dancing to the
singing of the birds, and I had often done that. Olive
didn't like it. We were not good friends for ever so
long afterwards."</p>

<p>"Olive wants to be head and front of everything,
and have the main attention. I'm sorry not to stay to
the wedding&mdash;it will be a grand affair. And no doubt
next year Olive will go off. You haven't many girl
friends, have you?"</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;she hesitated delicately and smiled in a
half absent but adorable fashion,&mdash;"I do not believe
I have. You see, we seem to live a little apart up on
this hill, and there have been lessons, and riding about
on the pony, and going over to your house, and most
of the girls are larger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The children all adore you. Oh, I hope you will
go over often. I don't know what Isola would do
without you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall," she said. "I'm so fond of music.
If I were a poet, a real poet, you know," and she
flushed charmingly, "I should write little songs to her
music. They go through my brain with lovely words,
and I can see them, but they don't stay long enough to
be written down. Oh, yes, I shall go over often. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
we shall talk about you. Of course, you will write to
your father, and we shall hear."</p>

<p>"Yes." Something, perhaps not quite new, but
deeper and stronger than any emotion he had ever
known before, stirred within him. If he were going
to stay here he would insist upon being her best friend,
her admirer, her&mdash;&mdash; He choked down some poignant
pain that was delicious in spite of the hurt. He hated
to think of leaving her behind, two long years. She
would be seventeen then; yes, old enough for any
man to marry&mdash;but she did not mean to marry, that
was the comfort. And he believed it because he
wanted to so very much. She was such an innocent
child. If this tumult within him was love, it would
frighten her, she would not know what it meant.</p>

<p>She slipped her hand in his. "We shall all be so
sorry to have you go, but then you <i>will</i> return. And
perhaps&mdash;oh, yes, I shall beg to go to London first,"
she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>He was different from an impulsive American. He
had been trained to have great respect for the sacredness
of young girls, and he owed a duty to his father,
who had planned out a prosperous life for him.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping down into the ocean, and the
fog, creeping along, sent gray and soft purplish dun
tints to soften and almost hide the gold. And, oh,
how the birds sang, freed most of them from family
cares. The meadowlark, the oriole, the linnets, and
the evening grosbeak, with a clear whistling chorus
after the few melodious notes of his song. They both
rose, and went scrambling down the winding path that
defied Pablo's efforts to keep in order. The shifting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
sand and the stones so often loosened and made rough
walking, so he held her up, and she skipped from one
solid place to another.</p>

<p>Down below they were moving some houses on the
newly cut street, so as to prepare for the next.</p>

<p>"They ought to begin at the top," she said, "but
I am glad they didn't. What a great city it is!"</p>

<p>"And if one could see the little town it was twenty
years ago!"</p>

<p>He would not stay to supper&mdash;he did sometimes. He
wanted to be alone, to disentangle his tumultuous
thoughts, and wonder if this thing that had swept over
him was the romance of love.</p>

<p>The next fortnight was very full. They went over
to Alcantraz to view the foundations for the new
fortress. They went up to Mare's Island, where, in
days to come, was to be the splendid navy yard, and
then on a day's excursion down the bay. There was
no railroad all along the coast line, though it was talked
of. And after a little they left the shipping and the
business behind them. All along were little clusters
of houses that were some day to be thriving cities.
Then long stretches of field where sheep were browsing,
the wheat and oats having been cut long before,
clumps of timber reaching back to the mountain
ridge, clothed in a curious half shade from the slanting
sun.</p>

<p>They left the boat at the little cove, and found a fine
level where they spread out the luncheon, and decorated
it with flowers, wild geranium, or rather geraniums
growing wild, some of it in tall trees. Vines creeping
everywhere, grapes ripening, figs and fruits of various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
kinds, that later, under cultivation, were to be the
marvels of the world.</p>

<p>Isabel and her betrothed, Olive and a young lieutenant,
were chaperoned by Mrs. Personette. Mrs.
Savedra, the governess, and all the children, with the
two from "the Hill," and Isabel's dearest friend and
chosen first bridesmaid. And now Olive cared very
little for her cousin, if he was a handsome young man.
He was going away, and she would be married before
his return, then he was too much of a student, although
an elegant dancer. So he could well be apportioned to
his sister and Laverne, neither in the realm of real
womanhood, or society.</p>

<p>They sailed up the western side of the bay, following
some of the indentations, and in the clear air the
Pacific did not seem so far away. The elders had
enjoyed the converse with each other. The young
people were merry, not even the lovers were unduly
sentimental. Mrs. Savedra watched her daughter and
noted a great improvement.</p>

<p>"If we could have Miss Holmes and Laverne all
the time," she thought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<br />
THE ENCHANTMENT OF YOUTH</h2>

<p>They went to wish Victor <i>bon voyage</i>. Laverne was
learning to play on the guitar, and another event happened
to interest her very much. Mr. Chadsey had
used his influence to obtain a position of first mate on
a vessel bound for Shanghai for Joseph Hudson, who
was expected in daily with his wife. No word had
come from the Estenegas. The two children had been
sent to Monterey, the old house dismantled, and now
swallowed up by the fine street that would some day
make a great driveway. For anything else the world
might have swallowed them up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hudson had been quite Americanized, but
was more deeply in love than ever. There was a certain
piquancy and dainty freedom that was very attractive,
quite unlike her former stiffness. She was
not afraid to go anywhere with José now&mdash;to the very
ends of the earth if there was need.</p>

<p>Captain Blarcom was delighted to secure the services
of so trusty a man and good seaman as Joseph Hudson
for his first mate. Being a trading vessel, they might
be gone two years or more.</p>

<p>"I shall send mamma a letter, and tell her the whole
story," said Carmen. "I have been so happy I think
she will soften her anger and not curse me as mothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
sometimes do. And perhaps, when I come back, she
may admit me to her again, since I was married lawfully
and by a priest of our Holy Church. For in
quiet moments one longs for the mother of all one's
earlier years. Only the life here is so much broader
and earnest, and every one seems working to some end,
not trifles that become monotonous."</p>

<p>"Yes," Miss Holmes returned, "I should write by
all means."</p>

<p>They kept her very close; indeed, she was rather
afraid to venture down in the town. And at last, the
ship was laden and ready, and another friend went
out of Laverne's life for a while at least.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later they heard the sequel of the
Estenegas' fortunes. Pascuel Estenega had been most
savagely angry that this young bride should have
slipped out of his reach, and left no clew. He blamed
the Convent Superior, he threatened vengeance on any
daring lover who had circumvented him. But no lover
or maiden was found, they had covered their flight so
securely. He grew more and more ill-tempered, until
hardly a servant would accept a position with him.
And on one occasion, for some trifling fault, he had
beaten his coachman so severely that he himself had
fallen into a fit, and never recovered consciousness,
dying a few days after. Then the Señora and her
daughters had gone to care for the elder man, who had
been made quite ill from the shock.</p>

<p>Isabel Personette's marriage was one of the events
of the early season. Even Major Barnard honored the
occasion with his presence, and the younger military
men were in their most notable array. There was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
elegant reception afterward, and Olive was in her glory
as the only Miss Personette. Howard's bent was mechanical,
and his father presently admitted that he
had chosen wisely.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was much call for ability in every direction.
A railroad had been projected to Sacramento.
Congress had established a line of mail steamers between
San Francisco and Shanghai. Between the city
and the Hawaiian Islands there was frequent communication.
Coal was being brought now from Bellingham
Bay, gas was furnished about the city, there were
rows of handsome dwellings. The new Merchants'
Exchange was begun, the Custom House would be
massive and beautiful. The shipping and mercantile
part of the city seemed to settle itself about Clark's
Point, on account of the great advantages it offered for
wharves.</p>

<p>Then there were several fine theatres and a large
music hall, erected by a Mr. Henry Meiggs, where
people of the more quiet and intellectual order could
patronize concerts, oratorios, and lectures. Private
balls were quite the thing, and people struggled to get
within the charmed circle, where an invitation could
be secured.</p>

<p>If the little girl had lost one friend, two came in
his place. Howard Personette constituted himself her
knight when they met at any gathering, and brought
them tickets for concerts, and new books or magazines,
when he found Miss Holmes was much interested
in them. There was indeed a library association
that readers found very useful, and the daily
papers were good news purveyors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>Richard Folsom felt he had something of a claim on
her friendship, and was importuning them both to
come to dinner and go to some entertainment.</p>

<p>"You show the result of your quiet life and freedom
from care," Mrs. Folsom said to Miss Holmes.
"You're younger looking to-day than when we met on
shipboard. I half envy you your easy time, and I
occasionally wonder if the money one piles up is worth
the hard work and anxiety. Only I had a son to look
after and place in the world. He was crazy to go to
the gold fields, but I think he saw enough at the Dawsons.
It's hard work to keep a boy from going to the
bad in a place like this, but Dick has grown up into a
pretty nice fellow. Now, if he can only marry a sensible
girl, one of the home kind, who isn't all for show
and pleasure! I wouldn't mind if she hadn't anything
but her wedding clothes. An early marriage
steadies a fellow."</p>

<p>But Dick wasn't thinking particularly about marriage.
He couldn't have told just why he liked to
climb Telegraph Hill an hour or so before sundown and
chat a while, bringing some rare fruit, or a new kind of
flower, and have a talk and a ramble about. There
were girls that were lots more fun, girls who jumped
at a chance for a drive behind his fine trotter, Hero,
and who didn't even disdain the Sunday drive to the
races. Miss Holmes never went to these.</p>

<p>Sometimes of a Sunday they all went over to Oaklands.
Mr. Savedra was much interested in the quaint,
intelligent man who was not only making a reputation
for honesty and fair dealing, but fortune as well. The
place was so lovely and restful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>The agricultural resources of the outlying places
were beginning to be appreciated. Gardens and farms
were found to be largely profitable since people must
be fed. Fruit, too, could be improved upon and bring
in abundant returns.</p>

<p>After several conversations with Miss Holmes, it
was deemed advisable to have an English governess,
since French and Spanish were as native tongues to the
children. Isola was improving in health, but quite
backward for her age, except for her really wonderful
gift in music.</p>

<p>"I can't seem to make up my mind to send either
of them away," she said to Miss Holmes. "We miss
Victor so much. And a mother's joy centres largely in
her children. I could not live without them. If I
could find some one like you."</p>

<p>"There are some still better adapted to the undertaking
than I should be," Miss Holmes returned
with a half smile. "I sometimes feel that I have
been out of the world of study so long, that I am old-fashioned."</p>

<p>"That is what I like. The modern unquiet flurry
and ferment annoys me. And pleasure continually.
As if there were no finer graces to life, no composure,
nothing but dress and going about. And you have
made such a charming child of Miss Laverne. How
pretty she grows."</p>

<p>And now she was growing tall rapidly. Miss
Holmes wondered occasionally what would happen
in a year or two, if, indeed, the idea of travel was a
settled purpose. Mr. Chadsey seldom spoke of it, except
to the child. He was very much engrossed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
his business. But presently she would need different
environment. She could not always remain a little
girl. And she <i>was</i> pretty with a kind of modest fairness
that had an attractive spirituality in it, yet it did
not savor of convent breeding. It was the old New
England type. She seemed to take so little from her
surroundings, she kept so pure to the standard.</p>

<p>They were at Mrs. Folsom's to dinner one day.
Uncle Jason had found it necessary to be away late on
business, and would come for them. He did not quite
like to leave them alone in Pablo's care, though Bruno
was a good keeper. But an evil-disposed person might
shoot the dog. He began to realize that it was more
exposed up on the hill now that there were so many
rough workmen about. Another year of it, and
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>They had a delightful little dinner in a "tea room,"
there was a great deal of coming and going in the large
dining room. And Mrs. Folsom said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask a guest in to share your company.
She's rather lonely, as her husband is away
on some business. They have been here a fortnight
or so. Laverne will like to hear her talk. She's been
most all over."</p>

<p>So she brought in Mrs. Westbury, and introduced
her.</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't intruded," the newcomer said, in
a peculiarly attractive voice. In a young girl it would
have been pronounced winsome. "I have been taking
some meals in my own room; I tired of going to the
public table when Mr. Westbury was not here. But
I do get so lonely. I generally go with him, but this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
was up to the mines, where the roughness and wickedness
of the whole world congregates, I believe."</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome," Miss Holmes replied,
with a certain New England reserve in her voice.</p>

<p>"You came from the East?" with an appreciative
smile, as if that was in her favor.</p>

<p>"From Boston; yes." Miss Holmes was always
proud of that.</p>

<p>"And I from southern New Hampshire; we're
not so very far apart. I married Mr. Westbury in
New York, but we have been about&mdash;almost everywhere,"
in a tired voice. "I had wanted to travel,
and I've had it."</p>

<p>Laverne's eyes kindled. "And were you abroad?"
she asked rather timidly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes," smiling. "I've lived longest in London.
And there's been Paris and Berlin, and, oh, ever
so many German towns, where they're queer and slow,
and wouldn't risk a dollar a month if they could make
ten by it. Most of the Eastern cities, too, but I think
this is the strangest, wildest, most bewildering place
I ever was in; as if the whole town was seething and
had no time to settle."</p>

<p>"I think that is it. You see, we are used to age
in our New England towns; permanent habits, and all
that. Yet, one would hardly believe so much could
have been done towards a great city in a dozen
years."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury raised her brows. "Is it as young
as that?"</p>

<p>"And we have people from everywhere who will
presently settle into a phase of Americanism, different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
from all other cities. Most places begin poor and accumulate
slowly. San Francisco has begun rich."</p>

<p>"And the newly rich hardly know what to do with
their money. You have some fine buildings, and queer
old ones, that look as if they had stood hundreds
of years."</p>

<p>There was something peculiar in the voice, and that
had been born with the girl, and had needed very little
training. It had an appealing quality; it indicated
possibilities, that fixed it in one's memory. She might
have suffered, had strange experiences, but one deeply
versed in such matters would have said that she had
come short of entire happiness, that hers was not the
tone of rich content. She had a delicate enunciation
that charmed you; she passed from one subject to
another with a grace that never wearied the listener.</p>

<p>Mrs. Folsom came in to see if all was agreeable.
She had taken a fancy to Mrs. Westbury, she had such
an air of refinement and good-breeding. Mr. Westbury
seemed a fine, hearty, wholesome man, prosperous
yet no braggart. That was apt to be the fault out
here. He had commended his wife to Mrs. Folsom's
special care, and paid liberally in advance, besides depositing
money at a banker's for his wife's needs.</p>

<p>They were having a pleasant, social time. When
the dinner was through they retired to Mrs. Folsom's
private parlor. In the large one there were card playing
and piano drumming and flirtations going on.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Westbury did most of the talking,
but she made sundry halts to give her listeners opportunity
to answer, and she never seemed aggressive. Laverne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
listened, charmed over the delightful experiences.</p>

<p>She had learned that these were more attractive than
one's troubles or perplexities, and she had set out to
be a charming woman. There was only one terror to
her life now&mdash;she was growing so much older every
year. She had kept her youth uncommonly, but alas,
no arts could bring the genuine article back.</p>

<p>Some lives go purling along like a simple stream that
encounters nothing much larger than pebbles in its
course, others wind in and out, tumble over rocks,
widen and narrow, and take in every variety. She
had been a mill hand, pretty, graceful, modest. After
having been a widower two years and married to a
woman older than himself, a bustling, busy worker
who lived mostly in her kitchen, Mr. Carr, the mill
owner, married this pretty girl, installed her in the big,
gloomy mansion, and made her the envy of the small
town where many of the families were related to him.
He had some peculiar views in this marriage. He
meant to rule, not to be ruled; he hoped there would
be children to heir every dollar of his estate. He succeeded
in the first, but in the twelve years there were
no children. She was miserable and lonely; there
were times when she would have preferred the old
mill life. Her only solace came to be reading. There
was a fine library, histories, travels, and old English
novels, and it really was a liberal education.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Carr died suddenly, having made a will
that tied up everything just as far as the law allowed.
She was to live in the house, a brother and a cousin
were to run the mill on a salary that was made dependent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
on the profits. A shrewd lawyer discovered flaws,
and it was broken. The heirs paid her very well to
step out of it all and have no litigation. She was extremely
glad. She took her money and went to New
York, and for three years had a really enjoyable time.</p>

<p>She was thirty-seven when she married David Westbury,
who was thirty-five. She set herself back five
years and no one would have questioned. After several
years of ill-luck, fortune had smiled on him and whatever
he touched was a success. He bought up some
valuable patents and exploited them, he formed stock
companies, he had been sent abroad as an agent, he
was shrewd, sharp, long-headed, and not especially
tricky. Honesty paid in the long run. And now she
had enjoyed seven happy, prosperous years. She had
proved an admirable co-partner, she had a way of attracting
men that he wanted to deal with and not
lowering her dignity by any real overt act. Her flirtations
never reached off-color. But of late she felt she
had lost a little of her charm. She was not inclined to
play the motherly to young men, nor to flatter old men.
Those between went to the charming young girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I'm so sorry to go," Laverne exclaimed,
when word was sent up that Mr. Chadsey was waiting
for them. "I've had such a splendid time listening to
you. It's been like travelling. And to see so many
celebrated people and places, and queens."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it. I hope you will come
again. Oh, I like you very much," and she leaned over
and kissed her, though she was not an effusive woman.</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey had been sorely bothered. A young
fellow he had had high hopes of had proved recreant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
and gone off with considerable money. He had been
straightening accounts, and trying to decide whether to
set the officers on his track or let him go&mdash;to do the trick
over again on some one else. So he only half listened,
glad to have his darling gay and full of delight. He
really did not notice when she said "Mrs. Westbury."</p>

<p>That lady had a talk with Dick the next morning.
He thought she was "quite nice for an old girl," so far
off does youth remove itself. Could she get a carriage
and ask Miss Holmes and her young charge to go out
with her?</p>

<p>"Why, I'll take you, ma'am, and be glad to. Oh, yes,
we're such old friends. It's odd, but we may be called
old settlers, really. A party of us came round the
Horn just at the last of '51. She was such a little
thing, the only child on board. And we all stayed and
are settled just about here. Tell you what I'll do.
We'll stop at school for her and take her home, and
then go on."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Holmes"&mdash;hesitatingly&mdash;"she ought to
have notice," smiling deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't count. You just take my word,
Laverne will be glad enough."</p>

<p>He was glad enough. He had a vague idea somehow
that Miss Holmes rather fenced him out. This
time he would have Laverne on the front seat with
him. Not that he really was in love with her now,
but in time to come&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His plan worked admirably. Laverne was delighted
and greeted her new friend cordially. They drove
around a little at first, then up to the hill, and now the
road was broken up unless one went a long way round.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>"I can run up," Laverne said eagerly. "I won't be
many minutes," and she sprang out.</p>

<p>"They're going to lower this hill," Dick explained.
"They started it once, but land! only a goat can climb
it now."</p>

<p>"Say a deer or an antelope," with a light laugh, as
both watched the child threading her way in a zig-zag
fashion, the shortest.</p>

<p>"It must be awfully lonely up there."</p>

<p>"But the prospect is wonderful. And there is
Golden Gate and the ocean. Still, I should like to be
more with folks. Chadsey doesn't mind. He's a queer
Dick, and his mind is all on making money."</p>

<p>"She is his niece. Are there any others?"</p>

<p>"No, I guess not. I never heard of any. All her
folks&mdash;family are dead."</p>

<p>"And Miss Holmes isn't related?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>They watched and saw them coming down presently,
but they took a better pathway. Miss Holmes
seemed pleased with the plan. Laverne sprang in beside
Mrs. Westbury.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the ladies&mdash;&mdash;" Dick was disappointed.</p>

<p>"I want to sit here," the girl said rather imperiously.
"And you know you won't let me drive."</p>

<p>"You'd be like that fellow you told of driving the
chariot to the sun, I'm afraid. I don't dare trust any
one except Nervy, the jockey, to ride her. It was immense
on Sunday. You saw that she won. Mother's
against having me enter her, and I don't do it often.
But jimini! I'd like to. And ride her myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury had seen the Derby, where all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
style of London went, and fortunes were lost and won.
Dick was fascinated by the account.</p>

<p>They turned oceanward. Sandhills, stones, patches
of verdure where one least expected, tangled depths of
laurels and alder, manzanita, vines scrambling everywhere
and such a wealth of bloom, then barren rocks
and sand. Now you could see the glorious ocean, the
great flocks of sea birds swirling, diving, flying so
straight and swiftly that not a wing moved. Cries of
all kinds, then from the landward side a strange, clear
song that seemed to override the other. Seals thrusting
up their shiny black heads and diving again, sunning
themselves lazily on the rocks.</p>

<p>"Is there another country in the world like this?"
exclaimed Mrs. Westbury. "And all down the coast!
I stayed at Monterey before. We crossed the Isthmus
and came up. It is wonderful."</p>

<p>Dick kept them out quite late to see the gorgeous
sunset, and then would fain have taken them home with
him. Laverne had her hands full of flowers that she
had never seen before, and her eyes were lovely in their
delight.</p>

<p>"I shall be spoiled. I shall want to see you every
day. I wish there was no school," Mrs. Westbury
said. "Oh, can't I come and visit you?" and the
entreaty in her voice would have won a harder
heart.</p>

<p>"Our home is so very simple, and now the streets
are in such a state, almost impassable. But if you have
the courage we shall be glad to see you," responded
Miss Holmes, curiously won.</p>

<p>"I shall come, most assuredly, although I have rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
begged the invitation. But you are so different from
the women of the Hotel. I do tire of their frivolity.
I even go out alone to walk, though at first I was
afraid. Could I meet my little friend at her school and
come up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she will be glad to pilot you."</p>

<p>It was late that evening when Jason Chadsey came
home. He looked tired and worn. Indeed, the farther
he went in the matter the worse it appeared. And the
culprit had made his escape. So there was nothing
to do but to pocket the loss.</p>

<p>"Shall I make you a cup of tea?" inquired Miss
Holmes.</p>

<p>"If you please&mdash;yes. Then I shall go straight to
bed; I must be up betimes in the morning. Is Laverne
in bed?"</p>

<p>She answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Friday Mrs. Westbury sent a little note to Laverne,
asking if Saturday would do for the visit. Every other
Saturday the child spent at Oaklands. So it was the
next week when the visit was made. She stopped at
the school for Laverne, and Dick Folsom was to come
for her in the evening.</p>

<p>"It is very queer," she declared, laughing. "It seems
a little like Swiss châlets built in the mountain sides
where you go up by wooden steps. Only&mdash;the sand.
I should think you would slip away."</p>

<p>"They are not going to take another street until next
year. Of course, we shall move; I think down in the
town. But it has been so delightful up here. And
it did not seem so queer at first. But since they have
been putting up such splendid buildings in the town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
and making such fine streets, it has given us a wild
appearance. Presently there will not be anything of
Old San Francisco left. A good part of it has burned
down already."</p>

<p>Miss Holmes welcomed her guest warmly and
brought her a glass of delightful fruit sherbet. The
place was plain enough, and yet it gave evidence of refined
and womanly tastes in its adornments. And the
clustering vines and bloom made a complete bower
of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury espied the guitar. She was really
glad there was no piano. Was Laverne musical?</p>

<p>"I've been learning the guitar. And I sing some.
But you should hear my friend at Oaklands. Her
voice is most beautiful. If mine was not a contralto
I shouldn't venture to sing with her."</p>

<p>"You don't look like a contralto. A pure blonde
should be a soprano."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'm not a very pure blonde," with a merry
light in her eyes. "I've heard concert singers who
could not compare with Miss Savedra, but her people
would be shocked at the idea of her singing in public.
I was telling her about you. We are great friends.
She is odd in some ways and foreign; they are Spanish
people, but I love her better than any girl I
know."</p>

<p>"And this Olive?" questioningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Olive. She took a great liking to me in the
beginning&mdash;we were quite children. She and the Savedras
are cousins. And her father married a friend of
Miss Holmes, but she is a delightful stepmother. Only
now Olive seems so much older and has lovers. Yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
we are friends in a way, but we do not really love each
other."</p>

<p>"And you haven't any lovers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no." She flushed at that. "I don't want any.
Why, I am not through school."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury found that she could not only read,
but talk French and Spanish, and that she was being
sensibly educated. But that was not the chief charm.
It was a simplicity that defied art, a straightforwardness
that was gentle, almost deprecating, yet never
swerved from truth, a sweetness that was winning,
a manner shy but quite captivating. And though she
told many things about her life up here on the hill,
there were no indiscreet or effusive confidences such
as she had often listened to in young girls.</p>

<p>When Mr. Chadsey met the guest as they were coming
in from the arbor, he simply stared at the name,
not realizing that he had heard it mentioned before. A
fair, somewhat faded woman, so well made up that she
could still discount a few years. Her attire and her
jewels betokened comfortable circumstances, indeed
wealth, for besides some fine diamonds she had two
splendid rubies.</p>

<p>Twice since he had been in California he had been
startled by the name. Once by a young fellow of two
or three and twenty, looking for a chance at clerking.
The other had been a miserable, disreputable fellow,
who had failed at mining and was likely through
drunkenness to fail at everything else. He questioned
him closely. The man had left a wife and family at
Vincennes, and would be only too glad to get back to
them. He had been born and raised in Indiana. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
he had helped him on his way, praying that he might
reach there. And here it had cropped up again. It
sent a shiver through him.</p>

<p>He questioned the guest adroitly, carefully. She
was proud of her husband and his successes. She had
met him in New York; she thought him a native of
that State.</p>

<p>Surely the David Westbury he knew could never
have had all this good fortune. So he dismissed this
case from his mind, and smiled over Laverne's new
friend, who would be one of the transient guests of the
heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Westbury sent word by a messenger that he
would be detained longer than he expected. He hoped
she found her quarters satisfactory, and that she would
take all the entertainment she could. He had
struck a new opening that would in all probability
make a millionaire of him. When he returned they
must go at once to London, and they might remain
there for years, since it was one of the places she liked.</p>

<p>Yes, she did like it, and had made some very nice
friends there. But&mdash;if she had a daughter like this
girl to draw young men; she should always yearn for
the young life that had never been hers, and a girl to
dress beautifully, to take out driving in the "Row," to
have one and another nod to her, to take her calling&mdash;that
was the way mothers did in England, to give
dainty parties for her, to let her tend stalls at fairs, to
have her some day presented to the Queen, and at
last to marry well. Her daughter might have such a
fortune. David Westbury had been lucky in a good
many things and he seldom made a mistake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>She dreamed this over and over again. She had
never cared for babies or little children, and she had
felt glad there had been no children to tie her to the
old New Hampshire town, where she must then have
spent her life. She had had so much more enjoyment,
larger liberty, and oh, worlds more money. Travelling,
hotels, meeting delightful people. But now her
day was about over. If there was a young blossom
growing up beside her to shed a charm around, to attract,
to fill a house with gayety, so she could go
through with it all again. Then lovers and marriage.
She should want a pretty girl, one with a winsome
manner. A little training would do wonders with this
one, who was just the right age to be moulded into success.</p>

<p>Of course, her uncle would never give her up, and
one could not coax her away. A man's journeying
about would have no society advantages. Miss Holmes
was very nice and sensible, but there were some old-maidish
traits. She was rather narrow. She really
pitied the girl's life between them. It would lose
the exquisite flavor of enjoyment that by right belonged
to youth.</p>

<p>Of course, all this was folly. But she did like the
child so much. And she wanted a new adoration,
which she believed she could win easily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<br />
IN THE BALANCE</h2>

<p>Agnes Westbury had listened all the early part of
the evening to her husband's enthusiastic plans. Good
fortune expanded him in every direction. It was true
that quicksilver had been discovered at Alameda, also
that the new process of separating gold was a great
saving. Working mines had been most extravagant
and wasteful. Some of the old ones had been deserted
that no doubt would pay again. He had taken options
for the London Company, he had two or three for
himself. Luck had surely come his way. Now they
must leave as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Had she enjoyed herself? Had the landlady been
satisfactory? Had she gone about and seen much,
made any pleasant friends? San Francisco was a
strange and wonderful place. It had risen up in a night,
as it were. It was in the line of the Eastern trade,
it would be the great mart of the world. What was
Congress thinking about not to establish a through
route, but depend on this miserable overland accommodation
for the crowds who would come! Its very
wildness and sublimity outdid Europe. Some day it
would be a worldwide attraction for tourists. Such
mountains, such a range of climate, such a profusion of
everything, such a seacoast line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>David Westbury was pacing up and down the apartment
with a light, springy step. He had been in his
youth a tall and rather lanky down-easter. Now he
had filled out, was fine and robust, with a good clear
skin. In those days his nose had been too large, his
mouth wide, with rather loose lips. Now the rest of
his face had rounded out, his lips had grown firm-set,
decisive, and his mustache was trimmed in the latest
style. Just at the corners of his mouth his beard had
begun to whiten a little, his lightish hair had turned
darker. Prosperity had made a man of him. He had
grown sharp, far-sighted, but he had an amiability that
was more than pleasing&mdash;attractive. He had learned
to use his own phrase, "not to buck against the
world." Where he had been rather credulous and lax
in early life, he had become wary and shrewd, and
did not hesitate if he could turn the best of the deal
his way.</p>

<p>"Yes, she had enjoyed herself very much. Mrs.
Folsom and her son had been most attentive, there had
been some star players at the theatres and a noted
singer or two. She had met some nice people, there
was a good deal of crudeness and display, but on the
whole it was very fair for a new place. And some
odd, quaint individuals, some really refined women
from Boston, and such a charming young girl that
she coveted; she wished she had her for a daughter."</p>

<p>"That's a queer wish; too, I thought you were not
fond of children."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not generally. I'd like them full-grown,
and attractive," laughing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind a fine, upright, sober, honorable
son that one could trust in all things, but they are
scarce."</p>

<p>"David, what will you do with your money?"</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;he laughed a little. "Let me see&mdash;endow
a hospital perhaps, or build a college. But we
must have all the pleasure we desire."</p>

<p>She gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>"About this girl, now?" he queried.</p>

<p>"She's the dearest, sweetest, simplest body, not
foolish, not sentimental, but like water in a ground
glass globe, if you can understand. She's one of the
old settlers, and that's laughable, came in '51, round
the Horn, from Maine, I believe, with an uncle and
some friends. He is a Mr. Chadsey, and keeps a big
warehouse, shipping stores and what not, and is, I believe,
making a fortune&mdash;to take her journeying round
the world."</p>

<p>"Chadsey," he said thoughtfully. "Chadsey. What
is the girl's name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Chadsey, too."</p>

<p>"Ah!" nodding, yet he drew his brows a little.</p>

<p>"I suppose he was her mother's brother. Her
mother died just before they came out here."</p>

<p>He made a brief calculation. "Yes, it was in '51
that <i>she</i> died. And Jason Chadsey was there,
he took the little girl away. At Boston all trace was
lost, though he had <i>not</i> searched very exhaustively for
her. He had a feeling that she would be well cared
for."</p>

<p>David Westbury glanced at his wife. Her elbow
was on the window sill and her cheek rested on her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
hand. There was a touch of sadness in her face, a
longing in her eyes. He loved her more now than
when he had married her. She was a little exacting
then. She had been very fond of pleasure, theatres,
balls, fine dinners at hotels, journeys, dress, jewels.
He enjoyed them, too, with the zest that generally
comes to one who has been deprived of them in early
life, and whose training has been to consider them
reprehensible.</p>

<p>They had taken their fill. Now his mind was all
on business; he liked to surmount difficulties, to bring
success out of chaos. He had to leave her alone a good
deal. She used to find entertainment in conquering the
admiration of young men, but these last few years
she had found herself less attractive, except as she
listened to their love troubles and begged her for advice.
He did not understand this at all, only he felt
he had an engrossing business and she had nothing but
looking on.</p>

<p>"You like this girl very much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can't tell just why, except that she is so
honestly sweet, so ready to give of her best without
expecting any return. Do you remember Lady Westmere
and her two daughters? They were fine girls
and devoted to her. I had not considered it much before,
but I understood then what an interest and solace
a young girl of the right sort would be. You know
I had Gladys Wynne to stay a month with me when
you were over to Paris. I had half a mind to engage
her as a sort of companion, and she would have been
glad enough to come. But I found she had some mean,
underhand tricks, and was looking out for her own advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
while she was trying to persuade you that it
was yours. And she told little fibs. So I gave up the
idea. A maid, you know, is no company, though one
must have her abroad. But we couldn't coax or kidnap
this girl," and she sighed in the midst of a sad
smile.</p>

<p>He still paced up and down. How long since he
had thought of that old life. He had always said to
himself that he had been a fool to marry Laverne Dallas,
but he had taken a good deal of satisfaction then in
"cutting out" Jason Chadsey. What fools young fellows
were!</p>

<p>"Agnes," he began, "before I married you I did not
tell you my whole story. I said I had lost my wife
and child, that ill luck had dragged me through those
early years. She had another lover, Jason Chadsey,
a seafaring man, of whom she had not heard in a long
time, when she married me. Some years later I was
at a low ebb and away, trying to make money for them
as well as myself. When I had a little success I went
back. She was dead and buried. Chadsey had come
back, it seems, and taken the child, since there were no
near relatives to say him nay. At Boston I lost trace
of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, David!" She sprang up and flung both arms
about him. "You don't think&mdash;this Laverne&mdash;why,
what if she should be yours!"</p>

<p>"She came here late in '51. Her mother died early
in the spring before. She must have been about eight.
Why, it's quite a romance for this prosaic world."</p>

<p>"If you are her father, you have the best right.
Oh, David, I should love her and be so good to her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
She should have everything, and I would be so happy.
Oh, you <i>must</i> see to-morrow."</p>

<p>There was a hysterical catch in her voice, and a
great throb at her heart.</p>

<p>"There, don't get into a fit. Why, I didn't suppose
you could care so much. Yes, I know you will be good
to her. Chadsey may kick about giving her up, but
I doubt if he took any steps toward legal adoption. Oh,
I think there will not be any real trouble unless she
will not come."</p>

<p>"But she ought to have some regard for her father!
And he isn't really her uncle or guardian. Why, it
wouldn't be quite the thing for her to travel round the
world with him."</p>

<p>They talked it over until their plans seemed most
reasonable. And then they wondered at the strangeness
of it. He had no real compunctions of conscience
about the past, though of course he would have accepted
the responsibility of his daughter if he could
have found her. He had a practical business way of
looking at matters. And while Agnes Westbury lay
awake, and had vague visions, dropping now and then
into snatches of dreams, he slept soundly and awoke
with a resolve to settle the question with just the same
purpose as if he had resolved to buy his wife thousands
of dollars' worth of jewels.</p>

<p>They had begun the necessary sea wall that was to
safeguard the piers and the shipping that grew more
extensive every year. Here was the old Fisherman's
Pier, then steamers, trading vessels, queer foreign
ships, business places of all sorts, many of them quite
dilapidated, fringed East Street. Here, where Clay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
Street ran down, almost meeting Sacramento, there
were warehouses, packing houses, boxes and bales and
general confusion. The one-story place with the sign
"J. Chadsey" over the wide doorway, not much handsomer
than that of a barn, but strengthened with iron
bars and great bolts, had stretched out and out, and
now they were packing in stores from the Orient, stores
from the Isthmus, that were being unloaded from two
vessels. Jason Chadsey had been giving orders here
and there, setting men at work, and was warm and
tired when word came that a gentleman wanted to see
him in the office. They made distinctions in those
days, even if the country was new and rough.</p>

<p>That was no strange summons. He pulled out his
handkerchief, and wiped the sweat and grime from his
face, listened a moment to the wrangling, swearing,
strange Chinese chatter, songs in various languages,
then turned and went in, hardly able to see at first from
the glitter of the sun that had drenched him. This was
a place just now with two big desks and a clerk writing
at one. The inner office had a window on the street
side and two wooden stools, one dilapidated leathern
chair before another desk.</p>

<p>A man rose up and faced him. A well-dressed, well-kept
man, with a certain air of prosperity and authority,
and if he had any scheme to exploit it would no
doubt have some advantage in it. But he was a
stranger.</p>

<p>"You are Jason Chadsey?" Westbury would have
known him anywhere. Except to grow older, to be
a little more wrinkled,&mdash;weatherbeaten, he had always
been,&mdash;and his hair slightly grizzled at the temples, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
was the same. There was honesty, truth, and goodness
in the face that had not changed either.</p>

<p>"Yes," Chadsey replied briefly.</p>

<p>"And you don't remember me?"</p>

<p>Chadsey tried to consider the voice, but that had
grown rounder, fuller, and lost all the Maine twang.
There had been so many faces between youth and this
time.</p>

<p>"Well, I am David Westbury."</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey dropped on a stool and stared, then
mopped his face again, while a shiver passed over him
that seemed to wring his very vitals, turn him stone-cold.</p>

<p>"It's odd how things come about." The man of
the world had his rival at a disadvantage. "I'd had
runs of hard luck," in an easy, almost indifferent tone,
being where he could laugh at the past, "and I'd tried
about everything in vain. I was too proud to come
back to Laverne empty-handed. Then, when I had
made something, I turned, hoping to ease up her hard
life, and found she was dead and buried. You had befriended
her; thank you for that. But you took my
child. I traced you to Boston. After that my search
was vain. I have looked over lists of vessels, thinking
to strike your name as captain or mate, and finally
given up search. Business brought me here, perhaps
fate, too, had a hand in it. My wife has seen and
known the child, and already loves her. I am grateful
for your care all these years, but I would rather have
had her in my keeping. I am a rich man&mdash;if I was a
poor devil I would put in no claim, no matter how dear
she was to me, but a father has the best right."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>Jason Chadsey rose. For a moment he had murder
in his heart. The man's evident prosperity and effrontery
stung him so. The past came rushing over
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know how I found her?" he began hoarsely.
"I had resolved to come out here. I was getting
tired of seafaring. I went to Munro to say good-by
to a few old friends. I expected to find her a happy
wife and mother, with little ones about her. Instead it
was a virtually deserted wife, who had heard nothing
of her husband in a long while, who had used up all
her little store and was in debt besides, who was suffering
from cold, want, heartbreak, and dying, knowing
no refuge for her child except the poor farm or to be
bound out to some neighbor."</p>

<p>"No, she would not have been," was the almost
fierce interruption.</p>

<p>"The dying woman did not know that. She had
some comfort in her last moments," and his voice softened
curiously with remembered pathos. "She gave
me the child. I have been father and mother to her.
You cannot have her."</p>

<p>"I believe the law gives the parent the right to the
child until she is of age. You had no consent of mine.
You could not legally adopt her, at least, it would not
hold in law."</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey turned pale under the tan of years.
Why, he had not even thought of any legal protection
for his claim. It rested only on love and care.</p>

<p>"You see," continued the confident voice, "that my
right has been in no way jeopardized. I am Laverne
Westbury's father, amply able to care for her in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
attractive and refined manner, place her in the best
society, to give her whatever education and accomplishment
she needs, the protection of a mother, the
standing of a father, travel&mdash;we are to go to England
shortly&mdash;and it would be worse than folly to stand in
her way."</p>

<p>"She will not go," Jason Chadsey said sturdily.</p>

<p>"She will if the law directs."</p>

<p>"She will not when she knows the struggle of the
last year of her mother's life. Why, you robbed <i>her</i>
mother, the poor, old, helpless woman, of the little she
had. You persuaded her to take up money on the
house&mdash;it was not worth much, but it was a home to
shelter them."</p>

<p>"Laverne was as anxious to get out of the place as I.
What could I do there? She was willing that I should
try. I was unfortunate. Other men have been&mdash;you
find wrecks everywhere. I struggled hard to recover,
and did, even if it was too late for her. We thank
Providence for our successes&mdash;doesn't the same power
direct reverses? It wasn't my fault. Luck runs
against a man his whole life sometimes."</p>

<p>"You could have written. That would have cheered
her solitary hours. She would have told you she was
dying, and begged you to come. When I think of
what that dreary winter was to her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were there to comfort her." There was a half
sneer on the face. "See here, Jason Chadsey, you were
her first lover, not a very ardent one, I fancy, either.
I was a fool to persuade her to marry me, though I
think her grandmother had a strong hand in it. You
were there those last weeks. Did she confess her mistake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
and admit that you had held her heart all these
years? What confidences took place?"</p>

<p>"None that you might not hear. Nothing but some
truths that I guessed, and wrung out of her&mdash;your
neglect. You would not dare to stain the mother's
memory to the child. If you did I think I could kill
you. Any one who knows aught about those New
England women, brought up among the snowy hills
like nuns, would know it was a base lie!"</p>

<p>"Come, come, we won't slop over into melodrama.
We will leave it to the law if you agree to abide by the
decision."</p>

<p>"The law will not force her to go."</p>

<p>"I think she will be convinced. You are no kin to
her. Now that she is grown, it is hardly the thing for
her to go on living in this fashion. You may mean to
marry her. That would be monstrous!"</p>

<p>"Go your way, go your way, David Westbury," and
he made an indignant gesture as if he would sweep
him out of the place. "I have other matters on hand.
I have no time to parley."</p>

<p>Then Chadsey turned and, being near the door, made
a rush for the street, plunging the next minute into the
thick of business. Westbury laughed a moment,
lighted a cigar, and sauntered out at his leisure. Up in
a more respectable street he glanced about, finding a
lawyer's office, and though he guessed the opinion must
be in his favor he wanted an assurance.</p>

<p>"If there had been an assignment under belief that
the father was dead, he could recover, if it was proved
he was the proper person to have the care of the child,
and amply able to support it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>Jason Chadsey worked furiously. He would not
think. It was high noon before he found a respite.
Then he went in the office instead of going to lunch.
He could not eat.</p>

<p>The shadow that would hang over him now and
then, that he had always managed to drive away, had
culminated at length in a storm that would sweep
from its moorings the dearest thing he held on earth,
that he had toiled for, that he had loved with the
tenderness of a strong, true heart, that had been
all his life. Without her it would only be a breathing
shell of a body, inert, with no hope, no real
feeling. Ah, if they had been ready to go away a
few months ago! If Laverne was of age! If he had a
legal adoption, they might make a fight on that. He
had nothing. But she would not go, she would not go.</p>

<p>Ah, how could he tell her? Perhaps her father and
yes, that soft-spoken, insinuating woman, was her stepmother,
and Laverne had a young girl's fancy for her&mdash;perhaps
they would go and lay the case before her,
persuade, entreat&mdash;oh, no, they could not win, he felt
sure of that. How could he ever go home! What
would the home be without her! What would life be&mdash;the
money&mdash;anything!</p>

<p>It was quite late when he climbed the ascent, growing
worse and worse. There had been two landslides.
Why, presently they would be swept away.</p>

<p>"Oh, how late you are!" cried the soft, girlish voice.
"How did you get up? Isn't it dreadful! Have you
had a hard day? Was there a steamer in? Do you
suppose we shall ever have a letter from the Hudsons?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing had happened. Perhaps David Westbury
did not dare. He almost crushed the slim figure in his
arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a bear hug!" she cried, when she could
get her breath. "And you are so late. We had such a
splendid big fish that Pablo caught and cooked, and it
was delicious. And I made a berry cake, but you
like that cold, and we will have the fish heated up. Was
it an awful busy day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a vessel in, and another to be loaded up."</p>

<p>His voice shook a little.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear old darling, you are tired to death.
Here's a cup of nice tea. And if you were a young
lover, I would sing you the daintiest little Spanish
song. Isola and I made it up. You see, things don't
sound quite so bare and bald in Spanish, and you can
make the rhymes easier. The music is all hers. We
are supposed to sing it to some one gone on a journey
that we want back with us."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm an old lover; sing it to me!" Then she
would not notice that he was not eating much supper.</p>

<p>The guitar had a blue ribbon, and she threw it over
her shoulder and shook her golden hair about. Tinkle,
tinkle, went the soft accompaniment. She had a sweet
parlor voice, with some sad notes in it, wistful, longing
notes. He wondered if she was thinking of any one
miles and miles across the water.</p>

<p>"It is tender and beautiful," he said, "sing something
else."</p>

<p>"You are not eating your cake."</p>

<p>"But I shall." He must choke down a little.</p>

<p>Afterward they strolled about the hill. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
no moon, but the stars were like great golden and silver
globes, and the air was sweet with a hundred fragrances.
Nothing had happened, and he wondered a
little at it. Suddenly she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you must go to bed after such a hard day's
work. And I am cruel dragging you about."</p>

<p>He could not tell her. Oh, what if he should never
need to tell her! How could he give her up? Was
life all sacrifice?</p>

<p>Something odd had happened to her. She sat by the
window living it over. She had gone around by Folsom
House to see Mrs. Westbury, thinking how she
should miss her when they went back to England.
She ran up to her room. There was a thin lace drapery
in the doorway to bring a breeze through and yet
shield the occupant from the passer-by.</p>

<p>"Oh, you sweet little darling! Did you dream that
I was wishing for you? I've been just crazy to see
you all day."</p>

<p>She was in a dainty white silk négligée, with cascades
of lace and some pale pink bows. She wore such
pretty gowns, Laverne thought.</p>

<p>"Do you know that in about a week we shall go
away? And I shan't know how to live without you.
I love you so! Why do you suppose I should be always
longing for you, thinking about you? Last night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She gave her a rapturous embrace and kissed lips
and brow and eyelids. Sometimes Isola Savedra
caressed her this way. But Isola was just a girl,
musical, vehement, Spanish.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep for thinking of you, longing for
you. Shall I steal you and take you away? Oh, if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
loved me well enough to come, you should have everything
heart could desire. I am so lonesome at times."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't come for the things," she returned,
coloring. "And if I loved you ever so much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't say you wouldn't. Oh, to-morrow I
shall have something strange to tell you, but now I say
over and over again I want you, I want you!"</p>

<p>Laverne drew a long breath. She was half magnetized
by the intensity, by the strange expression in the
face, the eager eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall be sorry to have you go." She hardly knew
what to say. Sorrow did not half express it.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me&mdash;yes, it is true, too. But I heard a
story last night that suggested such a splendid possibility.
I couldn't sleep. And I can't tell you just yet,
but when you hear it&mdash;oh, you'll be tender and not
break my heart that is so set upon it. Something you
can do for me."</p>

<p>"I will do anything in my power."</p>

<p>"Remember that when I ask you."</p>

<p>She was fain to keep her longer, but Laverne had a
curious feeling that she could not understand, a half
fear or mystery. And then she had some translation to
make for to-morrow. She was studying German now.</p>

<p>She worked steadily at her lessons. Then she had a
race with Bruno, and waited out on the steps for Uncle
Jason. What would happen to her to-morrow? It
might be an elegant parting gift. How strange Mrs.
Westbury had been. No one had influenced her in just
that way before.</p>

<p>Then she went to bed and fell asleep with the ease
of healthy youth. Jason Chadsey tossed and tumbled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
What would to-morrow bring? How would Laverne
take it? Must she go? Would she go? How could he
endure it?</p>

<p>"One," the solemn old clock downstairs said.
"Two." He had half a mind to get up. Hark, what
was that? Or was he dreaming? Oh, again, now a
clang sharp enough to arouse any one. Fire! Fire!
He sprang out of bed and went to the window. Was
it down there on the bay? He stood paralyzed while
the clamor grew louder, and flames shot up in great
spires, yellow-red against the blue sky. And now an
immense sheet that seemed to blot out the middle of the
bay, as if it could run across. "Clang, clang," went
the bells.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it, fire?" cried Miss Holmes.</p>

<p>"Fire down on the docks. I must go. Do not disturb
Laverne."</p>

<p>Let her sleep now. She would know sorrow soon
enough.</p>

<p>He dressed hurriedly and went out. The stars were
still shining in the blue sky, though round the edges
toward the eastward there were faint touches of grayish
white. But the zenith seemed aflame. Up went
the great spires grandly, a thing to be admired if it
brought no loss. He went stumbling down the rough
ways in the semi-darkness. Once a stone rolled and
he fell. Then he hurried on. Other people were out&mdash;you
could discern windows crowded with heads. Was
San Francisco to have another holocaust? There were
shrieks and cries. The noise of the engines, blowing of
horns, whistles, boats steaming up, others being towed
out in the bay, wooden buildings hastily demolished to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
stay the progress of the red fiend. Crowds upon
crowds, as if the sight were a new one.</p>

<p>On the corner of Davis Street he sat down on a barrel,
close by a stoop, overwhelmed by the certainty.
Why go any nearer? The rigging of a vessel had
caught, the flames twisted this way and that by their
own force, as there was no wind, fortunately.</p>

<p>All the labor of years was swallowed up, her fortune,
her luxuries, her pleasures. Another twelve months
and it would have been secured. But, alas! she would
not be here to share it. Did it matter so very much?
His soul within him was numb. Since he had lost her,
what need he care for a prosperity she could not share?</p>

<p>The hot air swept his face. Pandemonium sounded
in his ears. Men ran to and fro, but he sat there in a
kind of dumb despair that all his life should have gone
for nought, labor, and love as well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<br />
THE DECISION OF FATE</h2>

<p>Pablo told them the heart-breaking news. But about
eight o'clock Uncle Jason returned. The fire was out,
there were only heaps of smoking ashes and smouldering
brands. Jason Chadsey had been warmly sympathized
with, proffered assistance to rebuild, to recommence
business, and would have been deluged with
whiskey if he had accepted. That was still a panacea
for all ills and troubles. But he refused, and wandered
about in dogged silence. No one knew the whole loss.</p>

<p>In the farther office desk he had slipped a box with a
string of pearls for his darling's birthday. Some one
had said pearls were for blondes, and in spite of much
out-of-door living, she had kept her beautiful complexion.
Then crushed by the astounding news, he had
forgotten about it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Jason!" Grimed as he was with smoke
and cinders, she flew to his arms, and sobbed out her
sorrow.</p>

<p>"There, there, dear." His voice had the stress of
fatigue and great emotion. "I am not fit to touch.
And I can't talk now. I am tired to death. Give me
a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I will go to school to-day," she said,
with fine disregard of rules. "And yet I ought.
There are the translations to be handed in."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, do go. I must get some rest."</p>

<p>"I'll come home at noon," kissing him fondly.</p>

<p>He nodded. He was a broken old man in what
should have been the prime of life. He drank his
coffee, then took the whiskey he had refused down on
the dock, went to his room, and after a good cool wash,
threw himself on the bed.</p>

<p>The fire was on everybody's tongue. Not that fires
were a rarity. But this might have been much worse,
yet it was bad enough for Jason Chadsey. The air was
still full of smoke, there was a dense fog and a cloudy
sky. Everywhere you heard the same talk.</p>

<p>The lessons at school went on well enough, though
Laverne's nerves were all of a tremble. Just after
eleven as recess began she was summoned to the reception
room.</p>

<p>David Westbury had been out to the fire and come in
again.</p>

<p>"Gad!" he exclaimed. "It's that Chadsey's place!
And he had a tremendous stock, a new shipload just
in, some others waiting to be loaded up. This is a
queer town where every so often there's a big fire.
The only amends is that it is rebuilt better. Half of the
old rookeries ought to come down, they look so forlorn
and ancient."</p>

<p>"Oh, David. Well, if he has lost everything he will
be the more willing to give up the girl."</p>

<p>"He will give her up, anyhow," in a determined tone.
Some things Chadsey had said still rankled in David
Westbury's mind.</p>

<p>He went downtown again. Yes, it was ruin sure
enough. Being prosperous now, he could afford to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
pity the unfortunate ones. Chadsey had gone home.
The police were in charge, to keep off the roughs and
the thieves.</p>

<p>"We must have the matter settled to-day," he declared
to his wife.</p>

<p>"I know where she is at school. Let us go there."</p>

<p>"Excellent. I should like to see her alone. It is
right that she should hear my story."</p>

<p>So to the school they went. Laverne came in a
little flurried, and yet bewitching in her simple girlhood.
Her bodice was rather low about the throat,
with some edging around, and a band of black velvet
encircled her white neck. Her skirt was ankle length,
and the man noted her trim, slender feet, with the high
arch of the instep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury kissed her with warmth and tenderness.
Her eyes were luminous this morning, and the
flushes showed above the delicately tinted cheeks; her
whole air was pleading, enchanting.</p>

<p>"You know I said there was a strange story for
you to hear," she exclaimed, when they had talked at
length about the fire. "Mr. Westbury will tell
you."</p>

<p>He began to pace up and down, as was his habit,
so slowly that it gave him an air of thoughtfulness.
Mrs. Westbury had her arm around Laverne.</p>

<p>"Yes, a rather curious story, yet numbers of these
instances crop out along life. Friends, often relatives
are reunited, tangled threads are straightened, mysteries
explained. In a little village in Maine lived a
girl and her two friends, they were a little too old for
real schoolmates. Her name was Laverne Dallas."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p>Why, that was her mother's name. And Maine.
She began to listen attentively, just as one pieces out a
dream that has nearly escaped from memory. And
Westbury! Why, she had forgotten she ever had any
other name than Chadsey&mdash;it was her story as well,
and now she looked at the man, who certainly had
nothing repellant about him, and the story of those
early years was pathetic as he lent it several appealing
embellishments. She really could not remember him
with any distinctness. The death of her grandmother,
the pale, reserved mother, coughing and holding on
to her side, the coming of Uncle Jason, who it seemed
was no uncle at all, her mother's death, and all the rest
was school and play.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" she cried, and hid her face on Mrs.
Westbury's shoulder.</p>

<p>"So you see you are my little daughter. Your own
mother is not here to care for you and make you happy,
but here is a new mother, who has learned to love you
unaware. And now we are returning to London, and
will take you with us, and give you the life that rightly
belongs to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she interrupted with poignant pathos.
"I cannot go. I could not leave Uncle Jason in this
sad loss and trouble. He has been so good, so kind,
so tender&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if an own father could not be that! Laverne,
my darling, my own little girl!"</p>

<p>If he had been poor he would have thought any child
a great burden. He was not the sort of man to make
sacrifices for any one. They would have irked him
terribly. But in prosperity he was very indulgent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
There are many such people. Jason Chadsey would
have shared his last dollar, his last crust, ungrudgingly.</p>

<p>They began to set the matter before her in a reasonable,
practical light. Henceforward she would be a
burden on Mr. Chadsey, who had already done so much
for her. She would have in her parents' care accomplishments,
travel, society, a lovely home, pleasures of
all kinds, and now she was old enough to enjoy them.
And they wanted her. Her father had the lawful
right, would have until she was of age.</p>

<p>"I must go home," she said at length. "It is so
strange. I must think it over. And if Uncle Jason
wants me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we want you." Agnes Westbury gave her a
tender embrace, as she wiped the tears from her own
eyes. They could not be allowed to run riot down the
cheeks as Laverne's were doing.</p>

<p>She rose unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Have you no word for me, your father?"</p>

<p>She went to the outstretched arms and hid her face
on his breast. She could not love all at once. She
could not break Uncle Jason's heart.</p>

<p>"I know it must seem strange, but I think Mr.
Chadsey will recognize my right in you. We must
see him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then," she interrupted. "Let me
have this afternoon to consider, to talk."</p>

<p>Her voice trembled from exhaustion. She took a
few unsteady steps. The noon bells began to ring,
and again she said she must go.</p>

<p>They importuned her to accompany them to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Folsom House to dinner, but she would not consent.
Then her father insisted that she should have a hack,
but she refused that strenuously. They walked together
some distance.</p>

<p>"Arrangements must be made to-morrow morning,"
her father said authoritatively. She felt as if she
had been metamorphosed into some other person.
Laverne Westbury! it made her shiver. She liked the
old personality so much better. Must she go away?
This was all the real home she had ever known, this
strange, odd, ever-changing Old San Francisco. Why,
over here there was a row of tents when they first came.
And the queer little one-room and two-room adobe
houses, and the tangled-up streets that ended at some
one's house. How plainly she could see it all!</p>

<p>She began to climb the hill wearily. Then some
one came to meet her, helped her tenderly over the
rough places. They did not pause at the house, but
took the winding path up to the pine tree that grew
more beautiful every year, with its shining needles and
gray-green, fuzzy buds, almost like little kittens rolling
and tumbling in the wind. Balder the beautiful
was resting here. Here Victor had really said good-by
to her. Why, Victor was in London. And suddenly
London seemed to emerge from the gloom of the
Tower, and the execution of King Charles and a hundred
other melancholy reminiscences.</p>

<p>"Laverne!" her uncle began.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! I know! They both came to school.
They told me everything. But I shall not go. Do
you think I could be so ungrateful, so heartless now in
all this trouble? And I love you. It is years of love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
between us, and only a few weeks with them. Oh, no,
no!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. A vireo came and sang
his merry lilt in the tree overhead. The fog and a
good deal of the smoke had cleared away, and the sun
was shining.</p>

<p>He was very glad of the love. It would comfort him
all the rest of the weary way.</p>

<p>"Listen, child," he said at length, and he went carefully
over the ground. The strongest point of all was
that the law would give her to her father the next four
years. And now he would have to start in anew and
make another fortune. "I am not too old," he declared,
with a little pride.</p>

<p>A word had caught her, just as one catches a ball
with a chain at careless throw.</p>

<p>"Four years," she said. "Why, then when I am
twenty-one I could come back. Four years only!
Will you be waiting for me? I shall surely come."</p>

<p>She would be married before that. A pretty young
girl with a fortune was not likely to be left on the bush.
He caught at it, too. It would smooth the way since
the parting had to be. He had nothing; Westbury had
it all.</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried impulsively, "I can think how you
loved my mother. Was she happy there at the last
with you? But you two should have been married,
and I should have been your child. Why do things,
wishes, events go at cross-purposes?"</p>

<p>Alas! no one could tell. It was one of the great
world's mysteries.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes summoned them to dinner presently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
She had heard the story, and though it was hard, they
had to admit that the child belonged to her father while
she was under age.</p>

<p>Half the night Laverne thought she would defy
them all and stay. Would her father want to drag
her away a prisoner? What was a father's love like?
Wasn't the playing at it better and holier; the sense
of loss somewhere else making it diviner, giving it a
yearning that a full right could never quite embody?
She did not like the full right to be taken, she would
rather be coaxed a little and led along. And she could
not positively decide about Mrs. Westbury. Some
girls she found were quite extravagant in their protestations
and then forgot. Olive was one; there was
another very sweet girl in school who wanted always
to be caressing the one she liked. Isola was not always
demonstrative. They did have some delightful
quiet times. Were not women girls grown larger
and older?</p>

<p>It was strange, Laverne thought, how nearly every
one was ranged on Mr. Westbury's side. The Personettes
admired him, Mrs. Folsom considered him a
gentleman, and at that time the term was a compliment.
The schoolgirls envied her the romance and the
going abroad. Even Miss Holmes thought it the right
and proper thing to do. Uncle Jason did not discuss
the right, with him there was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Other matters troubled him. Property had been
queerly held in the city. There had been squatters,
there had been old Mexican deeds, claims coming up
every now and then to be settled with difficulty.
Jason Chadsey had leased the ground and the waterfront
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
when it had not been very valuable. He had
bought one building, erected others. In a year more
the lease would expire. Already large prices had been
offered for it. He could not rebuild, though generous
friends had proffered him any amount of money. He
felt unable to take the stir and struggle for no end,
that he could not explain. Like a wounded animal, he
wanted to go off in quiet and seclusion and nurse his
hurts. He had been worsted everywhere, let him give
up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury had wisdom enough not to make her
claim at all onerous. There would be plenty of time on
the long journey. Every day her old friends seemed
dearer to Laverne. At Oaklands they bewailed the
separation, but recognized its rightfulness, its necessity.
To Isola it was a joy that she would see Victor,
and she sent no end of messages.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savedra said to Miss Holmes, "If you desire
to make a change, we shall be more than glad to have
you."</p>

<p>David Westbury drove his wife and pretty daughter
about with a proud, satisfied air. Agnes shopped for
her, "just enough to make her presentable," she said
when Laverne protested. But, after all, the parting
was very hard.</p>

<p>"You must not come and see me off, Uncle Jason."
She could not renounce the dear, familiar name. "If
you did, I should give one wild leap and land on the
wharf, and you would have to keep me. Four years&mdash;it's
a long, long while, and there will be room for a
great many heartaches in it, but one day they will be
healed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>He obeyed her, and did not come. There were
many friends who did. So she went sailing out of the
Golden Gate on as fair a day as she had first entered it.
Oh, how the sun shone and tipped the waves with
molten gold. Never were skies bluer. Even the rocks,
and the clefts, and the crannies brought out their indescribable
colors, browns that deepened through every
shade into purple and black, grays that were pink and
mauve and dun, blues that ran into sapphire, and green
and chrysoprase. Telegraph Hill and the old, time-worn
semaphore. Oh, farewell, farewell, dear old
San Francisco!</p>

<p>There was some trouble getting insurance matters
straightened up and paying debts. Jason Chadsey had
lost the spring of ambition and life. He would take
a voyage up north with some of the explorers, then he
would think of the next thing. Four years. Oh, no,
she would never return. The bright, laughing, gay
world would swallow her up.</p>

<p>Marian Holmes pitied the man profoundly through
this time. They had been excellent, sensible friends.
There had been two or three occasions when she would
have married him if he had been really in love with her.
She knew now why his love-day had passed. She enjoyed
her own life, her own neat ways, her liberty.
She and Miss Gaines were still very warm friends, and
the latter would have liked her to come with her.</p>

<p>"I have a fancy to try it at Oaklands, and help
Americanize these charming people, perhaps spoil
them. It will be very easy and delightful. The
daughter will be a rather curious study. If she were
poor, she would have a fortune in her voice. She has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
quite a gift of poetry. I shall try to keep her from
morbidness and a convent, now that she has lost her
friend. And her mother wants her fitted for marriage.
How these foreigners harp on that!" laughing
a little.</p>

<p>Laverne Westbury cried herself to sleep many a
night, though in the daytime she took a warm interest
in all about her, and tried to be agreeable, tried to draw
near to her father. He was proud of her prettiness, of
her refined ways, the delicacy that had come down to
her from the New England strain. It was English, and
she would "take" over there. Then he was glad to
have Agnes so happy. It was like a girl with her first
doll. Often Laverne would rather have been left alone,
but she tried not to be ungracious.</p>

<p>They crossed the Isthmus, quite a new experience.
They went up to Washington, where David Westbury
had an excellent scheme to exploit that did get taken up
afterward. Then to Liverpool. The little girl never
dreamed there would come a time when one could cross
the continent in a week, the ocean in another, and her
father's expectations seemed quite wild to her.</p>

<p>There was a visit over to Paris. Eugénie was at
the height of her popularity, but now she had to take a
little pains with her beauty. Still she was the mother
of a future Emperor, she was a favorite daughter of the
Church, she set the fashions and the manners of the
day and did it most admirably.</p>

<p>It was not possible for a girl to be unhappy or cry
herself to sleep amid such charming surroundings. Her
French was very useful, she had been so in the habit of
using it at home that she did not take it up awkwardly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>Then they must go to London and get settled. They
would have a real home, an attractive place where they
could entertain. Mr. Westbury would be away a good
deal on flying trips, and now he would not mind leaving
his wife with her pleasant companion. He really
grew fond of Laverne in a proud sort of way. He liked
women to have attractions. He was not jealous, he
had found his wife too useful to spoil it by any petty
captiousness.</p>

<p>Laverne was really amazed. A simple little home,
Mrs. Westbury had said, but it seemed to her quite
grand. A pretty court, the house standing back a little,
a plot of flowers and some vines, a spacious hall with
rooms on both sides, a large drawing room, smaller delightful
apartments, sleeping and dressing rooms upstairs,
a man and several maids, and a carriage kept on
livery.</p>

<p>On one side of the hall were an office and a smoking
room devoted to the gentlemen who called on business,
and there were many of them, but they did not disturb
the ladies.</p>

<p>Some old friends came to welcome Mrs. Westbury
back, and this was Miss Westbury, who had been at
school in the "States" while they were travelling about,
and now would remain permanently with them. Mrs.
Westbury sent out cards for a Sunday reception and
presented her daughter to the guests. She was something
delightfully fresh and new, a pretty, modest girl
who might have been reared in any English family, and
who was not handsome enough to shine down the
daughters of other mammas.</p>

<p>It was her very naturalness that proved her greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
charm. And Mrs. Westbury found she had not made
any mistake in desiring her. Young men sought her
favor again. Older men lingered for a bit of bright
talk. Laverne felt at times as if she were in an enchanted
world. How could youth remain blind to the
delight?</p>

<p>Then all the wonderful journeys about to famous
places, art galleries, concerts, drives in the parks. It
seemed as if there was no end to the money. Since
prosperity had dawned upon David Westbury he had
made it a rule never to want twice for a thing be it indulgence
of any reasonable sort, once when he had, and
once when he had not. His plans were working admirably.
A golden stream was pouring in and he was
in his element. A few years of this and he could retire
on his competency.</p>

<p>She wrote to Miss Holmes and heard from her the
current news about every one. Olive Personette was
well married. Isola had a music master, an enthusiastic
German, who insisted such a voice should not be
hidden out of sight and hearing. Her father had been
persuaded to allow her to sing in St. Mary's Church,
recently completed in a very fine manner, on Ascension
Sunday and there had been great enthusiasm over the
unknown singer. Elena was growing up into a bright,
eager girl who rode magnificently and danced to perfection,
and was already drawing crowds of admirers,
much to her mother's satisfaction, and would make
amends for Isola's diffidence and distaste of society.
Dick Folsom was still flirting with pretty girls.
Nothing had been heard from Mr. Chadsey, except
that he had gone up to the wild Russian possessions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
There was inclosed a letter from Mrs. Hudson,
who was a happy mother, and José was the best
of husbands.</p>

<p>Laverne wondered at times how it was possible to
hear anything of Victor Savedra. Girls were so hedged
about here, everything they did inquired into. It would
not be proper for her to write, and if she had an answer
Mrs. Westbury would know it. She kept an excellent
watch over her pretty daughter. She was really glad
no one heard from Jason Chadsey. In this round
of pleasure Laverne would soon forget that crude life,
and not care to go back to it.</p>

<p>She did find many things to interest. But the Westbury
society was not of the intellectual type. Then
there were no stirring questions about one's own town.
London seemed a great agglomeration of small places,
and was to a degree finished. There was no especial
Steamer day, there was no influx of miners, no great
bay with its shipping at hand, and, oh, no great ocean
with its multitude of denizens to watch.</p>

<p>Yet, of course, there were other wonderful things,
the galleries, with their pictures and statues, only it
seemed to her that people went quite as much to see
each other's fine clothes. There were the churches, the
palaces, the great piles of learning that had trained
Englishmen hundreds of years. Mr. Westbury took
them to the House of Commons to a debate that he was
interested in, but she felt a little disappointed. Somewhere
at Oxford was Victor Savedra, but what was
one amid the great multitude?</p>

<p>They went over on the French coast for a summering
and Laverne found herself quite a favorite at once. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
was so modest and unassuming. American tourists had
not invaded every corner of Europe. And a young
American who knew French and Spanish people at
home, where no one supposed they could be found,
where they looked only for wild Indians, was indeed an
unusual personage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury was proud of her stepdaughter. She
was so tractable, it was so easy to keep her out of the
reach of undesirable admirers. Indeed, she thought
she should be jealous when Laverne came to have
lovers.</p>

<p>Then back to London again, visiting at country
houses where there were hunts and much fine riding,
pretty evening balls, queer old women, titled and bejewelled,
to whom every one seemed to bow.</p>

<p>And it was while they were at Thorley that Lord
Wrexford came home from the Continent, where he had
been trying to live cheaply for a while. He was five and
thirty, very well looking and agreeable, and though he
had taken on some flesh he was not too stout for dancing,
so he was invited out considerably, though he was
not esteemed a catch in the matrimonial market. For
it was well known that Wrexford Grange was nearly
covered with mortgages. The old lord was helpless
from paralysis, not able to sign his name, and too
infirm in mind to consent lawfully to any measures
looking to the disposal of the old place. Indeed, his
death was looked for almost any time.</p>

<p>He came with a purpose beside dancing. A friend
had said: "See if Westbury can't do something for
you, or put you in a way to help yourself. He has some
companies under way that are simply coining money."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I thought he went to America."</p>

<p>"He did and has been back a year perhaps. Lord
Elsden is in one company. It has something to do with
quicksilver, and there's a gold mine. You used to be
quite cronies."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was a good fellow. He helped me out of
one difficulty."</p>

<p>So he went to Thorley Wold not only to dance, but
the day after the ball he took David Westbury over to
Wrexford Grange and they went through papers and
debts, some to the Jews that had been ruinous and were
now pressing.</p>

<p>"You see," the younger man said, "if I stood alone
I should let the place go. You must know of chances to
make money out there in the new countries. I'd start
off to-morrow if I could, and hunt up a gold mine."</p>

<p>"They are not always to be found," smiling with a
touch of shrewdness. "And mining isn't just the
thing for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A scion of nobility. What did I read the other day?&mdash;some
lucky fellow unearthed a nugget worth thousands."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;that does happen," nodding rather incredulously.
"Well, if you want me to, I will take these
papers to London with me and see what I can do for
you. It's a fine old estate."</p>

<p>"And nothing to keep it on. Oh, I shall get out
of it fast enough when the poor old Governor is gone.
It's a good thing he's past worrying over it, or knowing
it, for that matter."</p>

<p>So they returned to Thorley in time for dinner, and
in the small dance that evening among the house guests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
he took Laverne Westbury out twice, and heard part of
her story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury did not think particularly of the matter
until Lord Wrexford had been at the house several
times and paid her some marked attention, invited her
and her daughter to visit Grosvenor Gallery and see an
especially handsome portrait, the work of a friend of
his who was coming rapidly up to fame.</p>

<p>"The fur on her wrap is so beautifully done that
it seems as if you might blow it about with a breath.
And she is an extremely handsome woman, was one of
the court beauties a few years ago."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury was very much pleased with her escort.
A title did go some distance in her favor, though
she never made any vulgar snatch at it.</p>

<p>"What about that Lord Wrexford?" she asked of
her husband one of the evenings they happened to be
alone.</p>

<p>He looked up from the stock list he was going over.</p>

<p>"The man or the estate?" with a short, rather
brusque laugh.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;both." Her smile might have been that of an
arch conspirator. A sudden thought occurred to him.
There were many business proffers made to him in
these days.</p>

<p>"He's trying to stave off some business until his
father has gone. He was willing to cut off the entail,
but the question arose as to whether his father was
capable, and the lawyers declare he is not. Some parties
are to bring suit unless certain claims are met. The
indebtedness is enough to swallow up the whole thing.
A fine old estate, too."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a pity the title cannot go with it," she remarked
longingly, with a meaning look.</p>

<p>"The young man can," and he laughed.</p>

<p>"I wonder some one hasn't&mdash;&mdash;" and she made a
suggestive pause.</p>

<p>"He might marry the daughter of a rich tradesman,
I suppose. He is really a better class fellow, and would
shrink from a lot of vulgar relations. Most of these
Commoners have such large families, and the other
class seldom have fortunes for their daughters. The
Jews will get the estate in the end, I think, and I am
really sorry for him."</p>

<p>"And he wants some help from you?"</p>

<p>"To tide over the present, he imagines. But it will
be for all time. Now, if you want a handsome estate
right in among good old families. You know we heard
about it at Thorley. It wouldn't be a bad speculation
if one wanted to live there. It's not such a great distance
from London."</p>

<p>"If one could buy the title," and she sighed.</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh and then returned to his list.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her luxurious chair and dreamed.
They really had something wherewith to purchase the
title.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<br />
TO SEE YOU ONCE AGAIN</h2>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Westbury had gone to Wrexford
Grange. Laverne was glad to have a few days to herself.
At first she wrote a long homesick letter to Miss
Holmes. Already she was tired of her new life. Yet
more than a year had passed&mdash;three years more and she
would be free. But how long it looked!</p>

<p>After Uncle Jason's tender love she was cruelly hurt
by her father's indifference. He was deeply immersed
in business and proud of his successes. Indeed, why
should he not be? He was shrewd enough to take no
honor in coming up from the ranks. He preferred to
have his patrons think he had always been quite high on
the ladder of fortune. Making money was now his
chief enjoyment, his one ambition. Laverne was a
pretty enough girl, but not the sort that drew men irresistibly
to her side. His wife was much more attractive.
And then Laverne brought some remembrances that he
wished strenuously to forget, that he had once dismissed
from his mind. He had made a little romance of it for
his wife's ears, and he had a vague fear that Laverne
might recall some disagreeable fact that it would not
be so easy to disavow. She never had, but he was not
sure how much might linger in her memory.</p>

<p>There was always a gulf between the father and
the child. He had demanded her mostly to please his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
wife, the rest to satisfy a little grudge against Jason
Chadsey that he had happened to possess himself of
the episode not at all to his, Westbury's, credit. From
the bottom of his heart he wished Chadsey had come
back in time to marry Laverne. It had been a most unfortunate
step for him, he reasoned.</p>

<p>Laverne had been in a way fascinated by Mrs. Westbury's
protestations of affection. She had appealed to
all that was sweetest and finest in the girl's nature, all
these years she had been studying men and women on
the emotional side, she was not capable of any intellectual
analysis. And though she could assume so much,
at heart she had very little faith in her fellow beings,
as she measured them mostly by herself. An attractive
young girl would draw young people, and she sunned
herself in the enthusiasms of youth, they were a tonic
to her. She did not mean to grow old, but she had a
quality rare in the people who cling to youth, she made
no silly assumption further than to use all the arts and
aids that she persuaded herself were quite as necessary
as a good diet to conserve health. She enjoyed her
world, her wealth, her little elusive pretexts and inventions,
and was amused to see how easily people who pretended
to discrimination were ensnared.</p>

<p>At first Laverne had been a new toy, a plaything, a
puppet that she could draw in any fashion that she
thought best. But presently she was amazed at the
child's utter honesty, her shrinking from dissimulation,
the surprise at some things she read in the clear eyes.
It had been pleasant, but now she was tiring of her toy.
Would she be the sort of girl who would draw lovers
to her feet and dismiss them with a wave of her fan?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>There was marriage, of course. This was really her
first season. The daughter of a rich man would not
lack offers. She wished she was a little less cold, self-contained,
indifferent.</p>

<p>And now a new scheme had presented itself. Why
should not Laverne be Lady Wrexford? If her father
became the virtual owner of Wrexford Grange, why
would it not be a fine dowry? And they could manage
that Lord Wrexford should be judicious in expenditures.
It might be best that the entail should not be
meddled with.</p>

<p>Laverne did enjoy the solitude. She was coming to
feel that she was watched continually, criticised
gently, of course, but often it hurt. And she had not
gone down to the real heart of anything. Was there
a heart or was it all surface living?</p>

<p>She went out to take her drive each day with her
maid. Several young friends had called.</p>

<p>One afternoon Preston brought up a card. "Mr.
Victor Savedra," Laverne read.</p>

<p>"He requested especially to see you," Preston said.
"I was not sure&mdash;&mdash;" and she glanced inquiringly.
"It is all right, quite right," the girl made answer,
but her heart was in her throat, her voice husky. She
stood there some seconds, fingering the card. Truth to
tell, she felt hurt that Victor had made no effort to see
her through all this time, knowing from his own family
she was in London. It was hardly her place to appeal
to him. Indeed, she had soon learned her old friends
were not subjects of pleasure to her new relatives. And
now she had quite given up hope with a sad heartache.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>Laverne walked slowly down the broad staircase,
lingered a moment, while she felt her color coming and
going in great bounds. Then there was a step, a figure
emerged from the reception room, and caught both
hands in his. Neither of them spoke, but simply
glanced in each other's eyes. He had changed, matured,
and was a really handsome young man in the
somewhat brilliant Spanish style. But the soft eyes had
not lost their olden tenderness.</p>

<p>"Oh," he began, "I was afraid I should never see
you again," and the glance seemed almost to devour
her.</p>

<p>"You have been in London all this time." There
was the faintest touch of reproach in her tone.</p>

<p>"And you? It seems to me if one can credit society
news you have been very gay."</p>

<p>She flushed, and her eyes were downcast, the brown
lashes making a shadow on her cheek.</p>

<p>"You must not upbraid me. I made some effort to
find you. I was so amazed at the strange turn of
affairs. Isola and mother wrote to me and begged me
to call on you. At last I did learn where you were and
sent you a note, directed to your father's care. It was
answered by Mrs. Westbury, who explained that you
were not in society, a gentle suggestion that I might
have been rather forward, also that you were going to
some French watering place, but no hint that I might be
welcome on your return," and he half smiled.</p>

<p>"I never saw the note&mdash;I never heard. Oh, did you
think I could forget an old friend when all things were
so strange and I so lonely?"</p>

<p>Now the lashes were gemmed with tears. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
longed to kiss them away. An infinite pity stirred his
heart.</p>

<p>"Have you been lonely and unhappy? Forgive me,
but I thought of you as gay and full of pleasure. I have
not been much in ladies' society. I have made some fine
friends among men, and it has been study, study, but
I have achieved most of my plans and pleased the best
of fathers. Last summer with some friends I made a
walking tour of Switzerland. This summer I return
home. I like America best. And how San Francisco
will look after four years' absence! Nothing of the
kind could happen in this staid old world. I wonder
sometimes if I have not dreamed part of it. And if I
have not dreamed about you! Oh, what a brute I am.
Come and sit down and let us talk it all over. And your
poor uncle&mdash;what do you hear from him?"</p>

<p>She wiped the tears from her eyes and in a broken
voice said: "Nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor child!" All his heart went out to her.
He had thought nothing of love before. He had been
but a boy, but he knew he loved her now with a man's
love, and with a sudden resolve he determined to take
her back with him even if it had to be his wife without
his parents' blessing and God speed.</p>

<p>"No one hears, I believe," she replied when she had
recovered her voice. "Only&mdash;I promised to come back
to him when I was twenty-one and free, and he will be
waiting for me, I know."</p>

<p>Then this new relationship had not been happy. He
had besought Miss Holmes to tell him about it, but she
had been very non-committal. He gathered from that
she had not been favorably impressed with either Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
or Mr. Westbury, although under the circumstances
there was nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>When they had recovered self-possession a little they
began to talk of the old times, the old days that had been
full of delight, it appeared, now touched by the enchanter,
memory. The first time they had danced together
when she was a little girl, his Saturday at the
old house, and the ride they had taken down the coast.
Snippy, and the verses they had tried to make for the
dead Balder. How he had hated to tell her <i>he</i> was
going away for four long years, and how glad he had
been to get Isola's extravagant letters, "for you
know she simply adored you," he confessed, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"It has all changed," she said mournfully, "There
will be no more San Francisco. The hill has been
lowered so much, and our old house has gone with it.
Olive was married in the autumn, you know."</p>

<p>"And Howard is turning into a fine young business
fellow, father writes. Uncle Personette may well be
proud of his children, who have had the kindest of
stepmothers. I always liked Aunt Grace and your
Miss Holmes. Mother thinks she couldn't do without
her. And it's queer," laughing a little, "she declined
a very nice offer of marriage that a friend of father's
made her, the captain of a vessel going up and down
to the Isthmus. She was very fond of you."</p>

<p>The sweet eyes filled with tears again. Had she left
all love behind in the grand city guarded by the Golden
Gate?</p>

<p>The room grew dusky. The maid came in to light
up, and glanced sharply at them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what an unconscionable visit I have been making,"
and yet he laughed lightly, not at all troubled by
the proprieties that he had really outraged&mdash;and he
knew better.</p>

<p>How very charming he was, standing up there, just
medium height, with one of the figures that is often
likened to Mercury or Ganymede. The rich tinted
Spanish complexion, the dark melting eyes, when he
smiled&mdash;could they ever look fierce? the narrow mustache,
leaving the red line on the short upper lip, the
chin rounded out with youth and health, the hands
dainty enough for a lady. They reached over and held
hers, the eyes smiled into hers, but all the same there
came a sharp pang at his going.</p>

<p>"For the next two weeks I shall be awfully busy,"
he explained. "Then come the Christmas holidays.
I didn't have any last year. I just stayed and ground
in the mill. I was bound to reach a certain point. But
now I shall spend a week in London. I think I can persuade
Mrs. Westbury to admit me."</p>

<p>Why should she not? Laverne thought.</p>

<p>A happy girl sat down to her solitary meal. She was
no longer lonely. Christmas was near. Of next summer
she would not think.</p>

<p>A letter came from Mrs. Westbury with news that
scarcely touched Laverne, and perhaps after all had not
much of real sadness in it. They had gone to Wrexford
Grange to settle some important business, and before
it was finished the poor old paralytic, who for the
last year had been scarcely conscious of anything but
breathing, had passed out of life. Lord Wrexford had
insisted upon their staying until after the funeral.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Would she mind if she gave up the Liscombes' dance?
Mrs. Leigh would be pleased to chaperon her, but it
would be in better taste to remain at home.</p>

<p>Laverne did this cheerfully. To be sure, the days
were rather lonely, but the driving and a little shopping
and going to some picture exhibitions with Mrs. Leigh
filled them up.</p>

<p>There was a pile of notes and invitations on Mrs.
Westbury's desk when she returned. Laverne often
answered the least important. Between them she sandwiched
Wrexford Grange. It was an old, old estate,
the title dating back for more than three hundred years,
and though it had been neglected of late could be put
in excellent order again. Such grand rooms, such
a splendid hall, such a great stone stairway with oaken
railing. Family portraits and a copy of the First
Charles,&mdash;the Wrexfords had been royalists,&mdash;but all
these things had been hidden away until the accession of
the son, with the old family silver, rather clumsy, she
thought, but she was wise enough to know that age redeemed
it.</p>

<p>"Oh," she began suddenly, "the Doncasters want
you for their Christmas Bazaar. The Thorleys are
coming up&mdash;yes, I think you must go. It is for the doctor's
pet charity, those crippled babies. I think it would
be a mercy if the Lord took some of the poor things out
of the world, but while they are here they must be taken
care of. It is only one day and evening. We must give
a luncheon to Florence and Claire Thorley. I'm sorry
Lord Wrexford must be counted out of the Christmas
gayeties. Yes, write an acceptance."</p>

<p>When she came down to the bottom she glanced over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
the cards, smiling, then frowning, not sorry to have
missed some of the calls.</p>

<p>"Victor Savedra," she exclaimed, "why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is those Spanish people at home, at least, the son
is here at Oxford, and he called."</p>

<p>She confessed it very quietly, without a change of
color or embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;let me see&mdash;he asked permission to call&mdash;I
think I told you&mdash;sometime in the early summer&mdash;we
were going away."</p>

<p>These little half truths annoyed Laverne, but she
made no comment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury had accomplished one step toward
what she thought would be the crowning point of her
life, and she was amazed that it had been done so easily.
As Laverne was an important factor in it she was prepared
to be very sweet.</p>

<p>"He is still at Oxford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he will be through in June, and then he will
return to America."</p>

<p>She was not even troubled when Preston told her the
young man had stayed two good hours. In fact, Laverne
was rather surprised at her amiability and indulgence.
She saw very little of her father, but he, too,
seemed awakening to a new interest in her. There were
business and board meetings and dinners of directors,
but he was always in excellent spirits. He sometimes
wondered himself how it was that fate seemed to send
everything his way. He was very lavish with Christmas
money to his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>So she went to the Bazaar in the best of spirits. She
really liked Amy Doncaster, though she was finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that the type of Olive Personette was by no means an
uncommon one. Amy was deeply interested in her
brother's hospital, and often visited it and made garments
for the poorer patients.</p>

<p>It was quite a pet charity in one circle. There were
hundreds of other things in the great city, but they
had their share of patronage. The hall was dressed
with evergreens, and though some of the half-hidden
flowers were paper they looked quite as pretty and did
not wither in the heat and light. Tastefully arranged
tables, with handiwork both useful and ornamental, attractive
for Christmas gifts; young girls in simple
white attire, the fashion of those days, older ones with
more elegance keeping supervision and adding dignity.
Carriages came and went before the broad doorway,
and visitors seemed generously inclined.</p>

<p>She was very happy, this charming American girl.
At the middle of the century there were not so many
of them to share and often fight for triumphs. Then,
Mr. Westbury had won a standing of his own and was
paving a golden path. It was not trade, something
that was held in higher esteem. Miss Westbury might
be quite an heiress. There was no older brother to
demand a share. For we had not outgrown the idea
that the brothers must be provided for first of all.</p>

<p>When the hall was lighted up and the young men began
to throng in, the scene was brilliant and the moneychangers
brought out their best charms and sweetest
smiles. Mrs. Westbury had been in during the afternoon
and had gone to a "high tea" at old Lady Carcroft's.
So in the early evening she came again.</p>

<p>Fred Doncaster, who had elected the Church for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
profession, since there was a very excellent living in the
other branch of the family, and he being a second son,
brought in his friend Victor Savedra.</p>

<p>"He is a Spaniard," explained Amy Doncaster to a
group of girls. "And isn't he handsome! Fred
brought him over once, they are great chums, and he
has the most charming manners. Oh, Miss Westbury,
he lives&mdash;well&mdash;it isn't far from that wonderful San
Francisco where you came from, and they must be very
rich, Fred thinks, though he never boasts of it, but it
must be something like a big English estate. Oh, they
are coming over here."</p>

<p>They made their way through, and Victor's face
lighted with intense satisfaction. Laverne flushed
"celestial rosy red." He reached over and took her
hand, exclaiming, "What a pleasure! I am so glad to
see you here."</p>

<p>"Hillo!" and Fred gazed from one to the other.</p>

<p>"We have been friends from childhood&mdash;isn't it?"
smiling out of his delight. "And Miss Doncaster&mdash;I
came almost purposely to buy some of your wares,"
glancing at that lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," she returned gayly.</p>

<p>The rest of the introductions were given and the
party fell into a social chat. Mrs. Westbury entered
the hall at that juncture with Mrs. Doncaster. A spasm
of something like anger shot over her. Yes, she was
quite sure that must be Victor Savedra. Was Laverne
making secret engagements with him?</p>

<p>"Oh," Mrs. Doncaster began, "there is Fred's
friend, a young Spaniard, who has been over here for
his education. We were all charmed with him when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Fred brought him to dinner one night, and wished we
had made his acquaintance earlier, since he leaves us
in the summer. The Spaniards, I believe, were some of
the old settlers on the western coast. I don't quite
understand all the distinctions of American people."</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury recalled the fact that she had met
the elder Mr. Savedra, who had come to say farewell
to Laverne and to assure her that they would do their
best to make Miss Holmes happy. Then she was formally
introduced to the young man, who had a notably
distinctive charm, partly due no doubt to his foreign
air.</p>

<p>Fred certainly was in high spirits, and helped the girls
in their sales, even if he did call them shopkeepers.
Then he insisted that Miss Westbury should accompany
him around to "spy out the nakedness of the land," he
said, which in this case meant an accession of funds
for the Hospital. "My brother <i>would</i> study surgery,"
he said, with a half protest. "Minturn is a born philanthropist,
so between us both we shall care for bodies
and souls. I'd worlds rather have my profession."</p>

<p>Amy and Savedra were talking just in front of
them, now and then pausing at a booth, where the girl
proudly introduced her companion. Some stalls were
already sold out; indeed, every one seemed jubilant
over the success. In a little rather private corner
groups were having some refreshments, and at one they
found Miss Doncaster and an admirer, who made room
for them, and they had a merry time. Victor sat on one
side of Laverne, and they exchanged bits of talk mostly
satisfactory to each.</p>

<p>Savedra had accepted an invitation from the Doncasters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
It was true Londoners were rushing out to
country homes, or to holiday house parties, but there
were hosts of them left.</p>

<p>"I had no idea the Doncasters knew you," Victor
said. "I am glad we have a mutual friend. I shall
spend all the holidays in town, and we must see a good
deal of each other to make up for the lost time."</p>

<p>Her eyes drooped and a delicious flush overspread
her face. How shy and sweet she was! He would
not think of the time when he must go away and leave
her behind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Doncaster accepted a seat in Mrs. Westbury's
brougham. The young people would walk home, as
the doctor headed the party. The girls had planned
to have a little dance the night after Christmas, just an
informal, suddenly arranged matter, and Laverne must
be sure to come. They were to go to a Christmas
dinner, but there was no engagement for Friday evening.</p>

<p>After they had set their companion down at her
own door, Mrs. Westbury still commented on the success
of the Bazaar and the prettiness of the girls.</p>

<p>"And I thought that young Savedra quite <i>épris</i> with
Miss Amy, didn't you? He was devoted to her."</p>

<p>"They all like him very much." She was so happy
there was no room in her heart for jealousy. Indeed,
gladness forbade the thought of possessorship.</p>

<p>"And English girls don't mind marrying and going
to the ends of the earth. That Miss Morven went to
Canada to marry her betrothed, who was in some
government position, and couldn't leave. And Lady
Estee's daughter went out to India. Of course, Laverne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
you will not give a second thought to Fred Doncaster.
It will be two years before he can be ordained.
And there's such a family, six children!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," returned Laverne cheerfully.</p>

<p>She had it in her mind to say: "Your father has
other views for you," but caution intervened. Still,
when she glanced her over in the light of her room as
she was saying good-night, she thought how really
pretty the girl looked to-night, her soft eyes shining,
her mouth settled in the curves of a half smile that
would tempt any lover to kiss, the clear, beautiful complexion,
the long bronze lashes that seemed to play
with the dainty color on her cheek, as the sun over
dimpling waters. Yes, she wanted the excitement of
pleasure.</p>

<p>Laverne went to the dance with great gladness of
heart and a strange freedom. Victor danced with the
Doncaster girls first, they were the hostesses. Then
it came Laverne's turn, and they had a delightful time
between the figures.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you remember how frightened you were
that night at Uncle Personette's? I really made you
dance, didn't I? I wonder that you were not vexed.
Was I worse than importunate?" laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you were so good, so delightful, to
take the trouble. And I was such a child. There
were so many big girls. How could I have been vexed?
That would have been ungrateful."</p>

<p>"We have always been such friends. And now I
shall venture to call on you. I had a fancy that Mrs.
Westbury didn't quite like&mdash;well, of course, you were
not in society. Customs are different."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>"You are going back so soon." She said it with a
most adorable little sigh.</p>

<p>"There will be the Easter vacation, and we must
make the best of this. When I am away I shall think
of you half the time. Let us see. Can't we make a plan&mdash;just
at twilight, let us say. No matter where we are
we will send a thought to each other. There's a queer
new belief, magnetism or some such thing, that you
<i>can</i> send an influence to your friends across any space,
that if you sit still a few moments and think of them
they will respond."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a most felicitous thought!" Could she
make Uncle Jason or any one think of her in that manner?</p>

<p>"Let <i>us</i> promise&mdash;just at twilight."</p>

<p>Some one took her in the next figure. What a slim,
graceful girl she was. How like a bird she skimmed
along when she ran races with Elena! And how they
had scrambled over rocks and sat on the summits overlooking
the ocean! There were no such fascinating
memories with any other human being. There was no
one quite like her.</p>

<p>And they did have a merry, delightful time. A
week of going somewhere every day, of chances to slip
in bits of charming confidences, of strolls in the old
Museum and other famous places, and then it came to
an end.</p>

<p>Fred and Savedra, friends as they were, dropped in
to say good-by. Mrs. Westbury was present. He
went over and took her hand&mdash;what magnificent rubies
those were!</p>

<p>"I want to thank you for a great deal of courtesy,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
he said, "and much pleasure. And now we must both
return to our old pastures and dig away at the dry
roots and forget about everything but the exams."</p>

<p>He shook hands quietly with both ladies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<br />
THE GUIDING FINGER</h2>

<p>Agnes Westbury watched her stepdaughter closely
when the two young men were gone. She did not
droop. She was happy and serene, compliant with
whatever was proposed. She made some visits to the
hospital with Miss Doncaster; that was safe enough.
Charity had not come to be a fad then, though there
were many earnest workers.</p>

<p>Mr. Westbury and Lord Wrexford took a run over
to Paris. After that he was a frequent visitor. Mrs.
Westbury had a curious charm for him. She was so
intelligent that he sometimes forgot it was like talking
to a man.</p>

<p>"You American women know about your husband's
business and never seem to think it a bore," he said
one evening. "Ours do take an interest in politics when
their husbands are up. And you have the art of making
attractive homes. Now, the average person would
have a certain stiffness about this place&mdash;&mdash;" The belongings
were of the regulation sort, and individual
taste was hardly comprehended.</p>

<p>She had added some easy chairs, an odd and pretty
table, with a series of shelves to hold books of engravings,
and portraits of celebrated authors and artists,
several fine vases disposed around, and these articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
announced with an air "we belong to the present mistress,"
the furniture belongs to the house.</p>

<p>"I like to take some comfort and not be continually
fretted with surroundings. As we are living in furnished
houses mostly, I can't suit myself. I don't pretend
to. I just have a little and dream of what will be
when we are permanently settled."</p>

<p>"I wonder if that will be here&mdash;in London?" tentatively.</p>

<p>"I think I shall not go back to America, 'the States,'
as you call it," smiling a little. "I shall have Laverne
to keep me company if Mr. Westbury has to take a
business journey. I confess to a fondness for the
older civilization. Our land is still in an undeniably
crude state. But so were you a few centuries back."</p>

<p>This woman had a curious charm in her frankness,
that was never rude even in its most truthful moments.
There was something about her that he could not define,
and that kept him studying and full of interest,
watching the next turn. If it was art, it was the most
judiciously managed. If it was due to temperament,
then, indeed, she had a many-sided nature. She kept
young, but it was not the shy simplicity of her daughter,
she seemed to have a wide range of knowledge, but
she was not pedantic, not obtrusive. There were
dainty concessions that flattered a man, little embellishments
that seemed an understanding of a man's
mood, too delicate for him to pick to pieces, if he
could. Then there was a mysterious charm about her
attire, a French adaptiveness of style, of something
made different from most women, with a touch of color,
a bow or a flower. She was a pleasant study.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>Now and then she delicately drew Laverne into the
talk. She asked her to bring over the portfolio of
Albert Dürer's engravings they had bought only a few
days before, and draw up the small buhl stand. Then
they discussed them and Holland; she had been reading
up a volume of travels that very morning, and was
as fresh as if she had just come from there. Laverne
was appealed to for this or that. She was not kept in
the background, but she seemed always flying there
with adorable shyness.</p>

<p>Afterward in his own room, smoking his pipe, he
thought the matter over, as he often did. He had
been rescued from an <i>esclandre</i>, his father had been
buried as became one of the old line of Wrexfords.
He could go back to the Grange with a certain prestige.
He might be asked to stand for Chediston. There
would be no more straits and pinches of poverty, and
he had suffered a good many during the last three
years. All this smooth sailing was conditioned on his
marrying Laverne Westbury. She was a nice enough
young girl, but he had had a surfeit of young girls. It
would be hard to bridge over the seventeen years between
them, very hard for her.</p>

<p>If it was the mother instead! Not being her own
daughter she was hardly likely to resemble her more
as time went on. He had a vague feeling that the
child was something less than money-making in her
father's life. All this matter was largely in her
mother's hands, and if the threads were not wisely
pulled, Wrexford Grange would be in her hands, too.
Yes, if <i>she</i> were single.</p>

<p>For the present he was out of society proper. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
went to his club, he called on a few old friends, and
he was taking a rather curious interest in one of the
new companies. He really might be a rich man
again.</p>

<p>So passed away a month or two. Mrs. Westbury
had meant to push Laverne into society, perhaps have
her "presented" at some Court drawing room in the
season. But as Lady Wrexford it would have a much
greater effect. There could be a marriage four or five
months after the old lord's death.</p>

<p>Was Laverne ignorant of the trend of all this?
She was thinking that at Easter she should see Victor
again, and that would be another bit of the old life to
sustain her exile. So she listened with only half attention
to hints and suggestions. She knew her father
had invested a good deal of money in Wrexford
Grange, and that her mother liked Lord Wrexford,
that as they were not very gay he enjoyed dropping in,
that he was their attendant on various occasions of the
soberer sort.</p>

<p>David Westbury said to his wife: "You had better
state the case to her. She has some of that New
England obtuseness. Well, she is very young. We
have grown much wiser in the world's ways since that
early period of our lives. It is the gain of experience,"
with a short, brusque laugh.</p>

<p>Then he kissed her. She always exacted that, and
it was generally freely given.</p>

<p>"I may not be back until late to-night," he said.</p>

<p>It was a miserable day, with a blinding fog that had
better have been a rain. Laverne practiced two hours
instead of one, then she read aloud in a novel of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
day. There was luncheon; some dawdling and scolding
about the weather.</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Westbury put her arms about Laverne
and looked into her eyes with an intense expression.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much you love me?" in a caressing,
pleading tone. "I'm trying to do all the nice things
I can for you; what would you do for me?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;there is nothing I <i>could</i> do," with a delicate
emphasis. Surely she could not spend all her life with
Mrs. Westbury&mdash;making that mental reservation.</p>

<p>"You <i>could</i> do something that would repay, that
would give your father and myself the greatest happiness."</p>

<p>She was not destined to hear it just then. Some
styles had been sent from the dressmaker's, would Mrs.
Westbury look them over and choose which suited her?</p>

<p>She was having a lavender satin made, and here
were also patterns of lace for the trimming. So they
discussed them. Then the postman, a few invitations
to answer. It was so dark the house was lighted up.
Laverne went to the piano again and tried to catch
some of the elusive things she had learned from Isola
Savedra. She could see the lovely, half-tropical home,
hear the sweet voices, smell the fragrances of a hundred
blooms. Ah, how lovely it must be on that Pacific
slope. She could have cried with rapture and pain.</p>

<p>Dinner, then a long evening. No one came in.
Laverne read, hardly taking in an impression.</p>

<p>"Put up the book, Laverne." The voice was persuasive,
but it struck a chord of fear in the girl's soul.
"Your father wished me to lay a subject before you
that is very near his heart, that would really crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
his endeavors for wealth and standing. And it is <i>my</i>
desire as well. I think I have always studied your
welfare from the time I snatched you out of that crude,
half-barbarous life. And a third person's happiness is
at stake."</p>

<p>Laverne shivered. A sudden light broke in upon
her. She had half fancied that she had been used as
a sort of blind that her mother might enjoy Lord Westbury's
society, but if it should be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What an odd girl you are, not a bit curious? So
I must put my story in plain terms."</p>

<p>It was embellished. In business statements Mrs.
Westbury could come to the point quickly, but she did
somehow dread this a little, for she began to mistrust
the girl she had fancied would be easily convinced.
She went briefly over the commercial side, and suggested
this had been done because Lord Wrexford had
taken a great fancy to her the first evening he had met
her at the Thorleys. For her sake and for her advantage
her father had rescued Wrexford Grange.
Any girl would be proud of such an opportunity.
Lord Wrexford was getting impatient, and desired to
make his proposal, though the marriage would not be
hurried unduly.</p>

<p>"I saw you were not dreaming of such a thing, and
your father thought I had better prepare you a little.
Think, Laverne, a simple American girl becoming Lady
Wrexford!"</p>

<p>Laverne threw herself at Mrs. Westbury's feet, and
buried her face on the elder's lap, shuddering in every
limb.</p>

<p>"Oh, I cannot! I cannot!" she cried passionately.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
"No, do not ask me. I cannot love him, he does not
love me. Why, it is like being sold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, you silly girl. There is no being sold about
it. He has asked for your hand honorably. It is a
chance out of a thousand. Any girl would jump at
it. Your father put his money in the Grange for you,
and you will be a most ungrateful daughter not to
accede to his wishes. When you have made up your
mind you will find Lord Wrexford most agreeable.
It can be a late spring marriage, and you really will
be the envy of many a high-born girl when you step
among them. You can be presented at the last drawing
room, Lady Wrexford! Why, you would be worse
than an idiot to refuse it."</p>

<p>Laverne rose. "No, I cannot&mdash;I cannot," shuddering.</p>

<p>"Your father will have his say to-morrow. There,
no words. You can go to your room, and resolve that
you will pay due respect to your father. You are
under age."</p>

<p>She was glad to go. Oh, yes, she had been blind.
For the last month Lord Wrexford had really been <i>their</i>
devoted admirer. Most of his conversation had been
addressed to Mrs. Westbury. Yet he had watched her
closely, she recalled that now. He had shown a delicate
solicitude in many things. Oh, could it be possible that
he really cared for her! That would make it so much
harder. And how could she meet her father, how defy
him! Yes, she was really afraid of him. Oh, if he
would only be angry and send her back to California!</p>

<p>She opened the window as if she could look across
to the old home. The fog was absolute blackness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
chilling, penetrating every nerve. She shut it down
again, but the breath of it seemed to strangle her. She
did not cry, her terror and dread were too deep for
tears.</p>

<p>She would hear him come home presently, his
full, strong voice, and they would talk it over. So
she listened and listened. The clocks inside struck
midnight, then the small hours. Would she never get
to sleep!</p>

<p>Somewhere toward dawn there was a sharp clang of
the bell, and strange voices. Then hurried steps up
and down, Mrs. Westbury giving a shriek, crying out
confusedly, calling the maid, going downstairs, then
a carriage driving away, and the servants still talking.
She opened her door.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it, what is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We were not to disturb you, Miss Laverne."</p>

<p>"But I was awake. I heard&mdash;has Mrs. Westbury
gone away? Oh, did something happen to father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss. He was hurt, knocked down somehow,
and taken to the hospital. But I guess it will all be
right. It's natural he would want Mrs. Westbury."</p>

<p>Laverne threw herself down on the bed, shocked.
One would never think of associating death with that
active, robust physique. Oh, no, it would not be that,
only some hurt. And if he should be ill and ask this
great sacrifice of her!</p>

<p>There was no word the next morning. The butler
had even forgotten to inquire what was the name of the
hospital. Laverne did not want any breakfast, she
wandered from room to room, she sat down at the
piano and played a few melancholy tunes. How hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the uncertainty was! Her very fingers grew nerveless.</p>

<p>At noon Lord Wrexford came. He was so gentle
and sympathetic that her heart almost went out to him.
He told the story with a tender gravity. Whether in
the dense fog Mr. Westbury had missed his carriage
or slipped and fallen no one knew. An oncoming horse
had stepped on him, and the injury was severe. There
had been an operation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"But he will not die! He cannot die! He is so
strong&mdash;Oh, surely, surely&mdash;&mdash;" and her voice broke.</p>

<p>"My dear child, we must wait and see. I am going
back. Mrs. Westbury will stay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had not the courage to say that a few hours
would end it all. The young, grief-stricken face
touched his heart. Yes, he would make her a good, kind
husband. If he were free to choose he would not
select her from all the women he knew, but now the
marriage would be imperative, and he would do his
best.</p>

<p>That evening he brought Mrs. Westbury home. She
would not see Laverne, but went at once to her room.
He told the child the story as far as any one could
learn the particulars. A horse's hoof had injured the
skull, crushed it in so that there was only a very faint
hope from the first, but he worded it delicately, and
stayed in the library all day, receiving the body when
it came, seeing various people, and having one interview
with Mrs. Westbury. After that she sent for
Laverne, and they wept together in each other's arms.
Laverne thought she must have loved him, she was so
shocked by his fate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>It was a distressing occurrence to all his friends, and
he had won many. Beside there was the great question
of what the two companies were to do without
the working head. Lord Wrexford proved himself
invaluable through these troublous days.</p>

<p>A sad Easter it was. The Doncasters and others
brought their warmest sympathy. Victor Savedra
came, and the pale girl in her deep mourning went at
once to the heart that had thought of her daily and
kept tryst. Ah, how should she tell him that since that
fatal night she had not! For now she began to understand
the great reason why she could never come to
care for Lord Wrexford. He had not asked her to
marry him, but somehow he had taken a lover's authority.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury had many subjects to revolve in her
mind, and was alarmed at first lest matters might go
wrong. So she accepted and acted upon the fact that
Lord Wrexford should be her son-in-law. She would
not give up the chance of this connection with nobility.
Besides Lord Wrexford was necessary.</p>

<p>Affairs were found in excellent order, and Mr. Westbury
gained in the esteem of the directors. But now
the company must assume the responsibility.</p>

<p>The new method of separating ore had been patented
in both countries, and was invaluable. Lord Wrexford,
it was assumed, had been a kind of confidential secretary
and his knowledge must be devoted to the company.
Mrs. Westbury had large interests, he was
made her agent at once.</p>

<p>Now, it was found that he had willed everything to
his wife, who was to make such settlements on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
daughter as she considered best. And she held the
right to Wrexford Grange.</p>

<p>She demanded the utmost affection and sympathy
from Laverne.</p>

<p>"Of course, you cannot understand all that he was
to me. Marriage interprets one to the other. And
you have only known him such a brief while. Then, I
think these placid natures cannot love and suffer like
the more intense ones. The shock has nearly killed
me. Oh, do comfort me! You are all I have left."</p>

<p>Laverne tried earnestly. But she noted that she
quickly overcame a paroxysm of grief when Lord
Wrexford or the lawyer came, and could spend hours
over the business.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, a few weeks afterward, "the
marriage must be put off a while, but it is more necessary
than ever. Your father felt you were too young
to be made independent. The Grange was to be your
dowry on your wedding day&mdash;to you and your children.
The marriage can be rather a quiet one, and in six
months, under the circumstances, you can lay your
mourning aside. Meanwhile we may be considering
the trousseau. We can go to Paris&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laverne threw herself at her stepmother's feet, and
clasped her hands in entreaty. "Oh, do not, do not
compel me," she cried, in anguish. "I do not care for
the Grange nor the money. If you will only send me
back to America&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall not send you back. I am your natural,
lawful guardian now. I shall do what I consider best
for you, and in the years to come you will thank me for
it. There, we will have no discussion."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>What should she do? A dozen plans came and
went through her brain. She remembered how Carmen
Estenega had run away from a hateful marriage.
But she had an ardent lover. This would be such a
long journey, and she would have no friends on the
way. Should she appeal to Victor? Oh, no, she could
not. Yet she had a consciousness that he would respond
at once.</p>

<p>She was coming to have a strange fear of Mrs. Westbury,
as if she might dominate all her life. Surely she
would if this marriage should take place. Oh, it could
not. She would not consent even at the last moment.
No one was forced to marry. Ah, would not Carmen
have been forced?</p>

<p>Lord Wrexford came and went. There were visits
from lawyers and directors, and calls of condolence.
A certain kind of peace, but it seemed like an armed
truce. And Laverne realized more thoroughly every
day that there had never been any true and tender love
for her in Mrs. Westbury's heart. She was older now,
and could see more clearly, had more discrimination,
yet she did wonder why her father's wife had been so
exigent. She could not understand the vanity, the
selfish desire for the admiration of this young soul.
And she also saw that Mrs. Westbury sought her own
advantage in this marriage. To be allied to the higher
orders, to be the mother-in-law to Lord Wrexford, to
have the entrée into the charmed circles. How had
she grown so wise!</p>

<p>She thought of her father with infinite pity, that he
should have been wrenched out of the life he enjoyed
so much. She felt that he had never truly loved her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
and that she had not succeeded in loving him. Always
her heart was turning back to Uncle Jason. Yes, that
was the sweet, tender, and true life, finer and nobler
than this striving and subterfuge, this greediness for
wealth and high places.</p>

<p>Lord Wrexford came one afternoon, quite a custom
with him now. Mrs. Westbury had been sent for to
some important meeting. He walked in with the easy
familiarity that characterized him, and passed a few
pleasant conventionalities. How many times she had
thought if she could see him alone, and now that the
opportunity had come she trembled with a certain kind
of fear and shame. What could she say to a man who
had not yet asked her to marry him?</p>

<p>He began to perceive that she was unduly excited.
The color wavering over her face and the quivering lips
touched him. He was not a heartless man, and every
day he was feeling this was more of a dilemma for
him.</p>

<p>"My child," he began, rather blunderingly, realizing
all the years between them, and then he saw that her
eyes were overflowing.</p>

<p>"Lord Wrexford," she tried to steady her voice, but
it trembled noticeably, "I believe I have been offered
to you as&mdash;as&mdash;an equivalent&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't put it that way," he interrupted quickly.
"Your father was very honorable."</p>

<p>"I do not know much about marriage, but it seems
as if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if youth and love should go hand in hand?
Middle age and money may make a dicker. But if
there were love, or if the title won you in any degree,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
and he knew there were some who would have been
won even by poverty and a title with the background of
the Grange.</p>

<p>"I do not love you," she said simply. "It seems
ungrateful when you have been both kind and patient.
Indeed, I have been trying&mdash;&mdash;" There was such a
wistful cadence to her tremulous voice that it touched
him, man of the world as he was. The slow tears
dropped from her lashes, but she could not raise her
eyes, though there was entreaty in every line of her
slight figure, even in the limp hands that hung by
her side.</p>

<p>"And a love that is forced is no love at all. But
you must realize the sacrifice you will make, and consider.
It will be more than giving up a title. Everything
is in your mother's hands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have told her that I do not care for the
money. I remembered so little of papa that he seemed
an utter stranger to me, and&mdash;some one had loved and
adopted me before. She knows I wish to go back
home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice faltered and broke.</p>

<p>"You are a brave little girl," he exclaimed admiringly.
"An honest and true one, and you deserve to
be happy, to love some one who has love and youth
to give in return." Did she know such a one? "I
think you are not taking root here."</p>

<p>"You know mamma is not any real relation," she
began as if in apology. "She has been very kind and
indulgent to me. I would like to please her. But, oh,
I would so much rather have been left in San Francisco.
My dear uncle would not have gone away. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
should have been poor, for he had just lost everything
in a dreadful fire, but I wouldn't have minded&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear child, you shall not be sacrificed." He
wanted to take the drooping figure in his arms, and
kiss away the tears that rolled silently over the softly
rounded cheeks. She looked so fragile in her black
frock. If she could be his little sister! But he had
nothing to dower her with, he would even lose the
Grange himself. But he said, "Do not give yourself
any further uneasiness, I will see Mrs. Westbury."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you a thousand times!" She did not
know how adorably her face lighted up. Yes, if she
had loved him it might have done. And if the race of
Wrexford died out with him what matter?</p>

<p>Laverne felt so much more friendly toward him that
she could not help showing it. Mrs. Westbury hailed
this with delight.</p>

<p>"Have you asked, and has she accepted?" she inquired
one afternoon when they were alone.</p>

<p>It was a warm day, and she defied custom sufficiently
to lay aside heavy crapes indoors. Her gown was of
some thin black stuff, trailing and cloud-like. Her
arms, that were well shaped, showed through in their
whiteness, and she often used them in a caressing sort
of manner. Her throat had the delicate prettiness of
art, and she looked really younger in this half simplicity.
The fragrance and quiet of the room seemed
to be a perfect setting for her, and it made her suggestive,
attractive to the verge of fascination.</p>

<p>"Neither," he said, drawing nearer. "We understand
each other. When the time comes, a year hence
or less, perhaps, I am going to ask you to accept the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
title to Wrexford Grange. It will suit me worlds better.
I have outgrown the bread and butter period."</p>

<p>She was very little rouged, and a color flushed up in
her face. She had cultivated the trick of this. She
was versed in men's meanings and knew this was no
idle compliment. But she was surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes, a year or so," in a slow charming manner
with becoming hesitation.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile be good to the poor little thing."</p>

<p>"Since you plead for her. I confess I have been
somewhat disappointed in her. Perhaps no child can
be quite like your own. She wants to go back to
America&mdash;shall I send her?"</p>

<p>She did not care for a daughter now. As Lady
Wrexford she would rather have all the homage. The
girl had been useful. There are people who can
drop one easily when no longer needed. Laverne
Westbury was too honest to be a comfortable companion.
And then&mdash;what if Lord Wrexford should
come to consider a younger wife preferable? Men <i>did</i>
change in many of their views, she had learned by experience.</p>

<p>In a way she had loved David Westbury. He was
fond of caresses, but she had never tired him of them.
She was proud of his successes, yet she had a conviction
that it was her money that had been the keynote of
prosperity. He was one of the men who dropped an
unsuccess very soon, and did not spend his energies
fighting his way through. For the first weeks she had
been crushed by the loss, and this she said to herself
was because of her deep love for him. When she
found that affairs were in a good shape, that she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
a rich woman, to be consulted by the directors, that she
still held many things in her hands, and that she would
have still more prestige by being the mother-in-law of
a lord, who had about sown all his wild oats, and found
the crop unprofitable; Laverne was of use to her.
And now with a better understanding the child had
become something of a trial. She was no longer a
half-blind worshipper.</p>

<p>"What friends has she there?" he asked after some
consideration.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose the man who adopted her is somewhere&mdash;he
was a lover of her own mother. And there
was another family connected with the Savedras&mdash;why,
there <i>is</i> the young man. I half suspected he was
a rival about Christmas time. And I'm not sure
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was here at the Easter holidays. Well, that
would be more appropriate. May and December, you
know," with a vague smile.</p>

<p>"You have a long later summer and autumn before
you reach December," and she raised her eyes with a
look of appreciation, and that admiration which always
touches a man's vanity. "I will not have you growing
old too fast. And I think almost any young girl would
fall in love with you, unless there was some prior claim.
Perhaps there was."</p>

<p>"He returns home in July. Well, why not give him
the opportunity?" smiling softly.</p>

<p>She looked undecided.</p>

<p>"At least give her a choice. I <i>do</i> admire her
sincerely. Many girls would not have refused a
title."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>She knew that. And Laverne's refusal was going to
bring her the best of good fortune. So she could afford
to pardon her high conscientiousness.</p>

<p>"I will have a talk with her. If we cannot make
her happy here, and I think she is not suited to this
sort of life, it would be cruel to keep her."</p>

<p>The reluctance betokened some affection on Mrs.
Westbury's part, he thought, though he could not divine
the secret joy this new aspect had brought her. She
was not desirous of sharing her right in him with anybody.</p>

<p>Laverne waited in a state of tremulous fear and
expectation. Mrs. Westbury was quietly gracious at
dinner. Afterward they retired to the library.</p>

<p>"Lord Wrexford came to me this afternoon when
you had dismissed him," she began rather severely.</p>

<p>She did not mean to be too lenient with the
girl.</p>

<p>"You have been most foolish and short-sighted,"
she said. "And knowing that it was your father's
dearest wish, his plan for a splendid future. The
money he put in Wrexford Grange was for you. He
would not have risked his money merely for the young
man."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't have married him. Oh, you do not
understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are a little fool. I suppose that young Savedra
stood in the way?"</p>

<p>Laverne was silent. She was glad she had her
scarlet face turned away.</p>

<p>"You pride yourself on truthfulness and honor, yet
you have been underhand and deceitful. You have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
carried on an intrigue with a lover while you assumed
a sort of ultra conscientiousness toward Lord Wrexford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laverne rose and came forward in the light. Now
she was very pale, but her face wore a high, serene
expression.</p>

<p>"You accuse me unjustly, Mrs. Westbury," she began
with quiet dignity, that awed the older woman.
"I have carried on no intrigue. No word of love has
been uttered between us. He has not asked me anything
that you and Lord Wrexford might not hear.
He wrote me a letter of condolence&mdash;if you would like
you can see it. It called for no answer. We had been
friends since childhood. The home at Oaklands was
like a second home to me. If Victor Savedra had been
engaged to Amy Doncaster I should have felt just the
same toward Lord Wrexford. Oh, I think he understands
it better than you do."</p>

<p>"You needn't be so tragic about it. I <i>am</i> disappointed
in you. I hoped to have a daughter who
would love me tenderly, sincerely. If I had been opposed
to the plan, your father would have left you there
in that wild land among barbarians, who do not know
what to do with their gold, when they have dug it out
of the ground."</p>

<p>No, it was not for any real love for her, she had
known that this long while. And now she understood
that she and her stepmother were on lines that were
too dissimilar for friendship even. She was an alien
and a stranger, she would drift farther and farther
away.</p>

<p>"You seem to have made up your mind that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
cannot be happy here, that my regard is worth very
little. Matters have changed with me somewhat. I
shall not keep this house, I must get away from the
remembrance that my dear husband has lain dead in
it, after the awful tragedy. And if you have any
choice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have, I have! Send me back home, that is
all I ask. And&mdash;I do not want the money. My
father's wish that you should have it all was right
enough. You see, I never seemed like a real child to
him. I do not think he cared much for my mother.
Yes, let me go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The voice with its pathos did pierce Agnes Westbury's
heart, but there were so many motives ranged
on the other side, and she persuaded herself that the
child really had been ungrateful and was incapable of
any ardent or sustained feeling. It would be much
better for them to part.</p>

<p>"I will consider," she said languidly. "Now go,
I have a headache, and these scenes are too much for
me in my weak and excited state. I have had so
much sorrow to bear."</p>

<p>"Good-night," Laverne said. She did not offer the
kiss that after it had failed to be tenderness, remained
a perfunctory duty, but now had ceased to be even
that.</p>

<p>"Good-night, to you. Mine will be wretched enough,
they always are."</p>

<p>But after a few moments' thought, and when Laverne
had dismissed the maid on the upper landing,
she stepped briskly over to the desk, turned up the light,
and wrote a letter to Victor Savedra.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>Fate or Providence had played into her hands always.
She would be very decorous and observe the
strictest propriety, but she counted up the months that
must elapse before she could be Lady Wrexford. She
had her lover in her own hands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<br />
AN ENCHANTED JOURNEY</h2>

<p>Was it a happy dream Laverne Savedra kept asking
herself, out on the broad ocean with no land in sight
and the great vault overhead, that by night filled up
with myriads of stars, that by day was a great unknown
country over which other ships went drifting to
ports beyond mortal ken. It was a much longer journey
then, but going round the world would not have
been too long for all the confidences she and her husband
never wearied of exchanging.</p>

<p>She felt a little confused that he should have appeared
so suddenly, with such a brave air, and in the
long talk told all his doubts and fears, the whisper he
had heard that she was likely to marry Lord Wrexford,
and that he found he had loved her since that
first evening they had danced together. And when he
heard that, he felt he had no right to keep a tryst with
her in the twilight, but still he could not put her out
of his thoughts. And to him Lord Wrexford seemed
quite a middle-aged man, and he wondered if the
Grange, said to be one of the fine old estates in that
shire, had won her with perhaps the persuasion of her
parents. Then her father's sudden and terrible death
had deterred him from a wild dream of coming to press
his claim, for he was not sure her regard was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
than a childish preference. And he, too, had been
brought up to respect parental authority. Then, there
were so many regulations in English society that he
feared to transgress, and he was desperately busy with
examination papers, and now all that trouble was ended,
and he should rejoice his father's heart by his degrees.
But there never would be any place to him like his beloved
California, so rich in treasures of the God-sent
kind, if she could not boast great universities and picture
galleries and libraries. They would all come in
time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Westbury had insisted upon one condition.
He was to destroy her letter and never make any mention
of it. For Laverne, with her ultra delicate notions,
might resent being offered to another lover. He
was to come as any friend might and learn for himself.</p>

<p>She had thought of the difficulty of sending the child
on such a long journey with only a maid. It was not
merely crossing the ocean&mdash;for then there was no cable
and even telegraph communications were apt to be
interrupted. But if she could be really married and in
a husband's care, the way would be clear.</p>

<p>Victor Savedra had hesitated a little. They would
hardly fail to accord Laverne a warm welcome; but
when his father had been so indulgent to him, to take
such an important step without his knowledge! But
there was no other course.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a generous trousseau, Laverne," she
said, "but your father's property is so tied up in stocks
and various things that I hardly know where to turn
for money for myself."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, please do not think about the money. I am
glad you are not displeased about&mdash;about&mdash;&mdash;" and she
colored deeply. "Indeed, I never thought of Mr.
Savedra as a lover. We had been such friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To have you Lady Wrexford would have been very
flattering to me, seeing that you were hardly in society.
But your refusal was so decided, and I must say, he
took it in a very gentlemanly manner. It might have
cost me my friend, even, and I should hardly have
known what to do. He has been most kind and
useful."</p>

<p>"I do not think he really loved me," Laverne answered,
with some spirit.</p>

<p>"The acquaintance had hardly been long enough for
that. And a man at his time of life has lost the impetuosity
of youth," the elder returned rather dryly.</p>

<p>Laverne had made one protest about the marriage.
She wanted to see Uncle Jason first. In a way she belonged
to him. If he were poor and unfortunate he
would need her so much the more.</p>

<p>"But you see you could not search for him alone.
We will both try to find him. And I think he is dearer
than your father was. I always liked him so much.
And his home shall be with us always."</p>

<p>"How good you are," Laverne murmured with deep
feeling.</p>

<p>It was not merely crossing the ocean, that was done
by even an unattended woman, it would be the remainder
of the journey, and that would prove simply
impossible. But Mrs. Westbury was determined to have
some reflected distinction in her stepdaughter. This
marriage had an aureole of romance about it. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
could wash her hands of Laverne in a very satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>So it was a very pretty wedding in church, with the
Doncaster girls for bridesmaids and a quiet reception to
say farewell to friends as they were to sail on the morrow.
Mrs. Westbury was modest in her white crêpe
dress with the plainest of adornment. The bride was
charming, the groom a proud and handsome young fellow.
Lord Wrexford bestowed upon her a handsome
necklace of pearls and gave her the best of wishes.
Mrs. Westbury parted with some jewels she cared little
about, but to enhance their value she said with well-assumed
emotion:</p>

<p>"They may be dear to you, Laverne, as mementoes
of your father. He was a good judge of such articles,
and would have the best or none. And in times of prosperity
he was most generous. Of course, he had not
always been as successful as during these last few
years."</p>

<p>The parting was very amicable, tender, indeed, with
the hope that Laverne and her husband would find
their way abroad again. It was hardly likely <i>she</i>
would ever visit America.</p>

<p>They began their new life as lovers indeed, but the
hopes of both were centred in the old place where
they had first met. Dozens of fresh recollections came
to light every day. His memory went back farther than
hers, and now they said "Old San Francisco." He
wondered how much it had changed in the four
years, and she supposed Telegraph Hill had been cut
down still more. Probably the old house was no more.
Pelajo had been sent over to Oaklands&mdash;would he be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
alive? And had the squirrels all been driven to other
wilds by the march of improvement?</p>

<p>A long, long journey it proved. All her life she was
to be a great traveller, but she thought then these two
journeys were enough to satisfy any one.</p>

<p>And at last the Golden Gate came in view. Oh,
had it ever been so grand and imposing before! Here
was the rocky frowning coast line with its few breaks.
The sun was not shining, but the soft, low clouds floating
in silvery gray, turning to mauve with here and
there a high light just edging them, gave the gray
brown rocks all manner of indescribable tints that
blended with the gray green lapping waves. There
was no stormy aspect about it, but a splendid, serene
peace. Even the gulls seemed to float in the mysterious
ether, the under side of their wings matching the prevailing
tint. And nothing screamed, or cried, or disputed.
Clusters were settled sleepily in the recesses
of the rocks. And way up above they could see Mount
Tamalpais with vales and woods and great sandheaps
between, and here was Sausalito, Point Bonito, Point
Lobos, as they entered in. They had reached the
Promised Land. Laverne glanced up with eyes full of
tears. The joy was too deep for words.</p>

<p>Here were streets running out to the newly begun
sea wall. Here were new piers, the Old Fisherman's
Pier made over. Why, Telegraph Hill had stepped
from its lofty estate, though there were still some
terraces left, some houses perched up high with winding
paths. Streets straightened down to Market Street,
which seemed to cut the city diagonally in two. The
old islands, the opposite shores, the towns that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
sprung up. How strange and yet how familiar. But
now going and returning was such an ordinary occurrence
that there were no great crowds to welcome
travellers. And every one seemed so intent upon business
that it almost confused Laverne.</p>

<p>There were three who came to greet them. Mr.
Savedra, Miss Holmes, and Elena, a tall girl now, with
flashing black eyes, a saucy scarlet mouth, and brilliant
complexion. And Miss Holmes was no longer young,
to Laverne's surprise, who had always held her in
mind as she had appeared on that first voyage, and who
had never noted any change in her when she saw her
day by day.</p>

<p>Victor had apprised his father of his marriage and
Laverne found herself tenderly welcomed, as a foretaste
of what was awaiting her on the opposite side of
the bay. So a little of the luggage was collected, to
follow them the next day, and they left the fine, new
mail ship for the ferry boat. The same old diversity
of people that looked strange now to the young girl.
And the whirl, the bustle, the confusion of tongues, the
jostling of rough and refined, how queer it seemed.</p>

<p>"You have hardly changed," Miss Holmes said
when she had studied her for some time.</p>

<p>"Haven't I?" with the old girlish smile. "Sometimes
I feel as if I had lived a hundred years in these
two. Oh, I shall have so much to tell you."</p>

<p>And yet she had an oddly pretty air and self-possession
of wifehood gained in these months when the world
of travel had held only each other, when every day had
brought new revelations.</p>

<p>The remainder of the family were out on the porch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
with open arms and kisses that it was worth crossing
the ocean to win. For it was early spring again,
with everything a vision of beauty, though they had
left midwinter behind somewhere. Oh, the fragrance
in the air, had she ever breathed anything so delicious
since she said good-by to the old place!</p>

<p>They were very glad to have her, if the marriage had
been out of the usual order. Isola had a mind to be
quite jealous of Victor, and that amused him greatly.
She had improved a great deal under Miss Holmes'
sensible care and training, and had an exalted, spiritual
kind of grace and expression. Laverne felt as if she
had gone into a new world, and the atmosphere was
enchanting.</p>

<p>There was so much to say that midnight came before
they had half said it. And it was not until the next
day she had the courage to inquire if anything had
been heard of Uncle Jason.</p>

<p>Miss Holmes smiled. "Mr. Savedra has a story for
you," she answered. "I will not spoil it."</p>

<p>He was walking up and down the path with Victor
when she ran out to him, eager-eyed and breathless.</p>

<p>"If you have missed one fortune, you seem in a
fair way for another," he began smilingly. "I have
been telling Victor." He put his arm about her and
drew her close. "Jason Chadsey's love for you is one
of the rare affections seldom met with. You know
we were all surprised to learn that you were no kin to
him. But your mother did wisely when she bequeathed
you to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have heard, you know&mdash;&mdash;" she interrupted
vehemently. "He is living. I&mdash;we," coloring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
"must go and find him. He was more than a
father to me. Oh, tell me," and he felt her pulse
tremble.</p>

<p>"You need not go. He will be only too glad to
come to you. Two months ago I was surprised when
he entered my office. At first I could not place him.
But his voice and his eyes recalled him. He had gone
through a variety of adventures. He admitted
that he had been eager to get away from the town and
forget his losses, though friends would have been ready
enough to help him in business again. He wandered
up to British Columbia, and all the land between he
thinks marvellous in its capabilities. It is like a
romance to hear him talk. Then he came down again,
sometimes trying the wilds and forests, and at last returning
to an old resolve that had taken possession of
him before he saw you&mdash;to go to the gold fields. And
thither he found his way about six months ago. At
first he was not much prepossessed. It seemed as if
everything worth while had been claimed. Then he
fell in with a poor young man dying with consumption,
whose claim had been very promising in the beginning,
but some way had failed, but he had not lost
faith in it from certain scientific indications. They
worked together for a while. This Jarvis, it seems,
had been at the School of Mines in New York. But
at the last he went very rapidly, and bequeathed his
claim to your uncle. A week after he had buried the
poor fellow he unearthed the secret again, and it was
just as he was about to give it up. He made no comment,
but worked steadily, burying his gold every
night instead of taking it to his cabin, and adroitly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
hiding the real lode. His companions laughed and
jeered, one after another left the gulch. Then, as I
said, he came down to me with two or three small bags
of gold nuggets hidden about his person. Upon assaying,
they turned out first-class. So he left them in
my possession and went back again, delighted that he
was at last on the sure track of your fortune. He had
the utmost confidence that you would return to him
when you were of age&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, poor, dear Uncle Jason! His life has been devoted
to me! But he must not take all this toil and
trouble. I do not care for the fortune. Oh, you must
believe that if I had not been compelled to go, I should
never have left him in adversity. It almost broke my
heart," and she paused in tears.</p>

<p>"My dear child, no one could blame you. There
was no other course then. I understand how he felt
about it."</p>

<p>"And now I must go to him at once&mdash;&mdash;" raising her
lovely eyes, full of entreaty.</p>

<p>"My child, it will be better to send for him. It is
a rough journey, and a miner's cabin will not afford
much accommodation for a lady," he returned, with
gentle firmness.</p>

<p>"But, I cannot wait. Why, I could fly to him," and
she looked in her beautiful eagerness as if she might.</p>

<p>"And Victor promised&mdash;&mdash;" glancing at him.</p>

<p>"We can send a messenger at once, to-day, and a
man can travel more rapidly, put up with hardships.
Neither can we lose you, when we have hardly seen
you. Think how patiently he is waiting, almost two
years more, he believes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span></p>

<p>Laverne did yield to persuasion at length. For that
matter not half the experiences had been told over.
They were all so glad to have her that she felt it would
be ungracious not to be joyous and happy. Elena
wanted to hear about London. Yes, she had seen the
Queen and some of the princesses, but she had not been
presented.</p>

<p>"She would have been, as Lady Wrexford," said
Victor laughingly. "And you can't think all that a title
counts for there. I wonder she wasn't tempted. For
I had not asked her then."</p>

<p>"But I had promised Uncle Jason."</p>

<p>Isola's music was a greater delight than ever. She
had improved very much under her careful training,
though her soul's desire was still improvising.</p>

<p>"Oh, how you would be admired in London,"
Laverne cried enthusiastically. "Such a gift is really
wonderful. Why some one ought to write it down."</p>

<p>"Professor Gerhart has tried some things. But you
see I never play them twice quite alike, and that bothers.
I want to turn this way and that," smiling, yet
flushing a little.</p>

<p>"Yes," Victor added, "you could make fame and
fortune abroad."</p>

<p>"But she could not play in public," said the mother.</p>

<p>Then they must take new views of the town.</p>

<p>"There is no more Old San Francisco," Victor declared.
"One would hardly credit the changes if he
were told."</p>

<p>There were streets now running out to Islais Creek,
where the marsh was being filled up. And the queer
little corner, where the streets ran a block or two in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
every direction by Channel Creek, still held some adobe
houses. Some day the Southern Pacific Railroad would
run along here and build its immense freight houses
and stations. Market Street was creeping along. Sandhills
had been toppled over into depressions. Great
buildings had been reared. Kearny Street was running
up over Telegraph Hill. The lower end was given
over to handsome stores, that displayed goods which
could stand comparison with any other city.</p>

<p>Telegraph Hill was to be lowered, even after this
revolution, that had left the topmost crest fifty or sixty
feet above sea level. It had a rather curious aspect
now. Some of the quaint old houses had been lowered,
and smart new ones formed a striking contrast. A few
scrubby oaks, firmly rooted, had defied removal, it
would seem, and were left in sandy backyards. The
beautiful pine was gone, the old house had not been
worth any trouble, and so had shared destruction.</p>

<p>"I can't make it seem real," Laverne said piteously,
with tears in her eyes. "There is no more Old San
Francisco."</p>

<p>There was no more little girl either.</p>

<p>But farther down the aspect was more natural. Here
was the new Presbyterian Church, where she had seen
the old one burn down. And here was Saint Mary's,
with its fine spire still unfinished. The Mission on
Vallejo Street, and St. Patrick's in Happy Valley, and
the fine school of Mission de Dolores, they had all improved,
though she found some familiar features.</p>

<p>And the little nucleus of China Town had spread
out. While the old Californian and the Spaniard relinquished
the distinguishing features of the attire, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Chinaman in his blue shirt, full trousers, white stockings,
and pointed toes set way above the soles, and
the black pigtail wound about his head, looked just as
she had seen them in her childhood, and they had not
grown appreciably older, or had they always been old?</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson had died, and his wife had retired to a
handsome private dwelling, and kept her carriage. The
Folsom House was much grander, and Dick, a "young
blood," whom girls were striving in vain to captivate.
Mrs. Folsom wanted to hear about her father's death,
and if her stepmother had lived up to her promises.</p>

<p>"I do suppose your father died a rich man. Or, did
it all take wings and vanish?"</p>

<p>Laverne answered that the business had not been
settled, and that Mrs. Westbury had proved very kind
to her.</p>

<p>"I never could quite make up my mind about her.
Queer, wasn't it, that she should take such a fancy to
you and insist upon having you, for second wives' fancies
don't often run that way. I had an idea she would
marry you to some lord, with all the money, they expected
to have. And here you've married that Mr. Savedra
and come back. Does any one hear what has become
of that old uncle of yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he keeps in touch with Victor's father."</p>

<p>"It was too bad he should have lost all by that
dreadful fire. Fires have been the bane of the town,
but we do not have as many now. Oh, didn't the place
look queer when we first came. There were rows of
tents still, and such shanties, and now great four-story
bricks and stone, and banks and business places. One
would hardly believe it if he had not seen it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Personette was in a large real estate business,
and even yet was hardly reconciled that Howard had
not gone into the law. But he was very well satisfied
with what he called "real business."</p>

<p>Mrs. Personette was stout and rosy, and had been
made a grandmother twice. Miss Gaines had taken
a husband, though she still kept up a very stylish establishment.
Sometimes the three old friends met and
talked over their adventures.</p>

<p>Laverne was very happy and added a great charm
to the household. Elena would have had her talk continually
about her life abroad.</p>

<p>"Why do you not make Victor describe some of
the places where <i>he</i> has been? Every summer he took
a journey away," she said, rather amused.</p>

<p>"He talks about places. You always put in the
people, and they are more interesting."</p>

<p>Jason Chadsey was startled by this message. His
little girl really here&mdash;but, after all, another's. At first
it gave him a sharp pang. Yes, he must fly to her.
So he picked up his nuggets again. Norcross Gulch
was about deserted. Better mining had been found
up on a little stream emptying into the Sacramento.
Cabins had mostly been carried off, shacks had fallen
down. Certainly, nothing could look more dreary than
a deserted mining region. But in a month or two another
horde would doubtless invade it.</p>

<p>He came in town and "spruced up," in his old Maine
vernacular, was trimmed as to beard and hair, and purchased
a suit of new clothes. His little girl! He
ought to take some great treasure to her. What if she
were changed; but no, they would love each other to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
the very end of life. He had sent her away in that desperate
time, but no, he could not have kept her.</p>

<p>Ah, what a meeting it was! A pretty girl with the
air of a princess, he thought, sweeter than some of the
princesses he had seen, coming back to his arms with
all the old love, nay, more than the old love. For now
she realized what his affection had been, and how he
had soothed her mother in those last sad days. And she
confessed to him much that she had not even told Victor;
how, by degrees, she had learned the hollowness
of the lavish professions that had put on the semblance
of love as the present whim had swayed Mrs. Westbury,
and, at the last, she had been really relieved to
dismiss her, because she could not bend her to her desires.
For even Laverne had not suspected her of aiming
at the title for herself.</p>

<p>"And she takes everything!" he said indignantly.
"He was concerned with a company that will make
some tremendous fortunes in quicksilver&mdash;an English
company. And it is said that he managed by underhand
ways to get possession of the tract while he was here.
They have just sent out a new agent, and that you,
his only child, should have no part nor lot in this!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mind," she cried, "I would rather belong
to you in poverty than to live with them in luxury. It
was dreadful to have him die that way; he was so fond
of life, and business, and plans. It makes me feel quite
free not to be under any obligation to them. And I do
not care about the money. I would a hundred times
rather have stayed with you and helped you, and comforted
you, if I could have been any comfort."</p>

<p>They would fain have kept Jason Chadsey for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
longer stay, but he was a little restless and would go
back. He had not secured all the Golden Fleece, he declared,
and he must live up to his name. But he would
see them often now. To himself he said, he must get
used to sharing his little girl's heart with another, and,
since it must be, he would rather have it Victor than a
stranger.</p>

<p>They were all very happy at the Savedras. The
house was large, and they gave them room and the
heartiest of welcomes. And there was room in the
rapidly growing town, and need for young men of culture
and integrity and all the earnest purposes of life
that mould men into fine citizens. For there was much
work to do in this glorious land, even if nature had
dealt bountifully by it.</p>

<p>And then came the terrific struggle that swept
through the country, with its four years of hopes and
fears, sacrifices and sorrows, and the loss of human
lives. California took her share bravely. Gold mines
missed the rapid influx, the city had to call a halt in
improvements. But a great interest in agriculture was
awakened, and now they understood that this might be
the most bountiful garden spot of the world.</p>

<p>Through this time of anguish to many, Laverne Savedra
felt that she had been singled out for good fortune
and some of the choicest blessings of life. Her
little son was born, and to none did it give greater joy
than to Jason Chadsey. He kept at his lode with
varying fortunes, and at length struck his aim in a
splendid nugget that for a while was the town's marvel.
Now the place swarmed again, and he was offered a
fabulous price for his claim. He listened at length to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
his earnest advisers, and retired from the field. For,
though he was not an old man, he had borne much of
the heat and burden of life, and won a resting time.</p>

<p>And, after years of trading about and buying a
boat of his own, Captain Hudson sailed in to San
Francisco one fine day with his wife and three babies,
bright rosy children, and she with content written
in every line of her face. He had a cargo of valuables
consigned to several San Francisco firms, and
they were overjoyed to meet old friends. When
her first baby was born, Carmen had written a long,
tender letter to her mother, and was glad to have
a reply, even if it did upbraid her dreadful disobedience.
After that matters softened. The old Papa
Estenega died, and, though there were still some
distant cousins, he left the estate to those who
had cared for him in his last days. Juana had
married well, and Anesta had a nice lover. She was to
go to Monterey to see them all as soon as Captain Hudson
could be spared.</p>

<p>And then, the last spike in the line that united California
with the East, was driven by Leland Stanford
in May, 1869. Railroads were being built elsewhere,
but this was the dream and desire of the Old San Francisco
that had almost passed away.</p>

<p>But nothing could take away the beautiful Bay and
the Golden Gate, the entrance to the golden land that
had been the dream of centuries.</p>

<p>Afterward they did go round the world. Some of
the old ports had changed greatly. Some just as Jason
Chadsey had seen them thirty or more years agone.
And there was wonderful Japan, which was some day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
to startle the world with its marvellous capacities.
Strange India, with its old gods and old beliefs;
Arabia, the Holy Land, with its many vicissitudes;
great, barbarous Russia, Germany, the conqueror, and
the beautiful Eugénie a sorrowful widow.</p>

<p>In Europe, Isola Savedra joined them, and did make
a name as a remarkable improvisatrice. She did not
court publicity, but the higher circles of music were
really enchanted with her marvellous gift, and invitations
came from crowned heads to play at palaces.</p>

<p>Lady Wrexford had achieved most of her ambitions,
and was a social success. If she could only have kept
off old age!</p>

<p>They came back well content. And, lo! again San
Francisco had changed, stretched out up and down,
with the hill-encircled bay on one side and the ocean-fretted
rocks on the other. Is this old Market Street,
and this Montgomery, with its splendid buildings?
Whole blocks taken up by spacious hotels. California
Street, with its palaces; Kearny Street, with its glittering
stores and throngs of handsome shoppers or promenaders&mdash;everywhere
a marvellous city.</p>

<p>But the old "Forty-niners" are gone, the Mexican
in his serape and sombrero, the picturesque Californian
on horseback, and nearly all the wandering Indians.
Tents and shacks and two-roomed adobe houses have
disappeared before the march of improvement.</p>

<p>The Savedras are prosperous and happy, and have a
lovely home out of the turmoil and confusion, where
beautiful nature reigns supreme. And an old, white-haired
man, rather bent in the shoulders, tells a group
of pretty, joyous children about the Old San Francisco
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
of half a century before, and the long search of Jason
after the Golden Fleece and the little girl that he loved
so well. They go up Telegraph Hill and say, "Was it
here she and Pablo made the little lake for Balder, was
it here she climbed up the crooked paths and tamed
birds and squirrels, and here that Bruno killed the cruel
fox?" It is more wonderful than any fairy story to
them.</p>
